<span class="smcap">From the Reformation to the present
time</span>.</h2>
<h3>CHAP. I.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Miscellaneous remarks on the
Reformation&mdash;its rise and progress on the
continent&mdash;introduction into this island, and effects upon
this town.</p>
<p>The reformation formed a new era in the history of the world,
and was one of those mighty revolutionary events which have a
most extensive and lasting effect on the affairs and destinies of
mankind.&nbsp; But men have been ever since greatly divided in
their ideas and judgments concerning it.&nbsp; While some have
hailed it as a most happy, admirable, and glorious event, fraught
with heaven&rsquo;s choicest blessings, it has been deemed by
others, and even by a large majority of the inhabitants of
christendom, as an exceedingly unfortunate, pernicious, and
execrable occurrence, which has produced all manner of mischief,
and, like the opening of Pandora&rsquo;s box, filled the world
with calamities and <a name="page624"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 624</span>miseries innumerable.&nbsp; The
learned and the wise, as well as the illiterate and fly foolish,
have been found among each of these opposite and contending
parties: their respective opinions and allegations must therefore
be entitled to a serious and candid hearing.&nbsp; But it is not
intended here to go deeply or largely into this disputed subject:
nor would it well accord with the plan or design of this
publication.&nbsp; Some cursory hints, however, on a few of the
most prominent facts will not, it is presumed, be either
impertinent or uninstructive.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> I.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Statement of different and opposite
opinions respecting the reformation&mdash;with brief
remarks</i>.</p>
<p>The information, like the French revolution, seems to have
been too much admired by its friends, and too much vilified by
its enemies.&nbsp; The former, for the most part, perceive
nothing in it but what is praise worthy and divine, and the
latter nothing but what is detestable and devilish.&nbsp; The
truth, probably, lies somewhere about midway between these two
extremes, as is usual in most of the disputes that divide and
agitate the world.&nbsp; The reformation had certainly some good
points in it, as well as some very bad ones, that can never be
too much reprobated and detested.&nbsp; Had they been all bad,
its friends would have defended them, for they have actually and
unblushingly defended its <a name="page625"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 625</span>very worst points; <a
name="citation625a"></a><a href="#footnote625a"
class="citation">[625a]</a> and had they been all good, its
enemies, on the other hand, would not fail to condemn them, for
they have really done so with its very best parts, whose
intrinsic or essential goodness and beneficial tendency are most
obvious and demonstrable. <a name="citation625b"></a><a
href="#footnote625b" class="citation">[625b]</a></p>
<p>The friends of the reformation consider the original and chief
actors in that great revolutionary work as excellent men,
actuated by a right apostolical and christian spirit, with a view
to the restoration of primitive christianity, and the promotion
of the best interests of mankind.&nbsp; Their opponents, on the
contrary, consider them in a very different light, and hold them
up as persons of a disreputable character, who were actuated by
very unworthy and base motives, from whose thoughts nothing could
be further than the restoration of genuine christianity, or the
promoting of real benevolence, philanthropy, or human
happiness.&nbsp; It will not be safe to give implicit credit to
either of these representations.&nbsp; There were, certainly,
some good men concerned in the reformation, and there were also
some very bad men concerned in it, whose misdeeds ought never to
be palliated; and these were probably the most numerous and the
most powerful, or the work, surely, would have been more worthy
of our praise and admiration.</p>
<p><a name="page626"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 626</span>The
reformation, in the judgment of its admirers, was eminently
calculated to promote the cause of truth and virtue, and
inculcate the practice of piety, morality, and all manner of good
works.&nbsp; All this, however, is flatly contradicted by the
champions of the opposite cause, who positively affirm that the
doctrines of the reformers were, in the very nature of them, of
an evil, immoral and impious tendency:&mdash;alluding to the
grand Lutheran tenet of <i>justification</i> by faith <i>without
works</i>, <a name="citation626a"></a><a href="#footnote626a"
class="citation">[626a]</a> and to the famous Calvinian notion of
predestination, as extending to all the deeds of men, bad and
good, or that all human actions, even the very worst, originate
in the <i>Divine decrees</i>, or <i>will of God</i>. <a
name="citation626b"></a><a href="#footnote626b"
class="citation">[626b]</a>&nbsp; This opinion of the evil
tendency of the reformation, or of the reformed doctrine, they
represent as further corroborated <a name="page627"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 627</span>and established by undeniable facts,
and authentic historical evidence; or in other words, by its
immediate effects, or the very first fruits it produced wherever
it did prevail.</p>
<p>Those who advocate the cause of the reformers say that their
labours were abundantly fruitful of good works, and that their
doctrine produced the happiest effects wherever it was
received.&nbsp; But their opponents flatly deny it, and
positively assert that the very reverse was actually the case:
and they support their assertion, not only by referring to those
long and bloody wars which resulted from the reformation, but
also to the express testimony of credible witnesses, who affirm,
that vice and immorality greatly increased wherever protestantism
became predominant.&nbsp; Nor is it a little remarkable that
these same witnesses are, for the most part, some of the very
chief reformers; so that their evidence comes with a force that
cannot well be resisted.&nbsp; Some of them belonged to the
continent, and others to this kingdom; but we shall in this place
bring forward only the former, reserving the latter till we come
to exhibit the rise and progress of the reformation in this
country.</p>
<p>We shall begin with <span class="smcap">Luther</span>, whose
testimony on this occasion is very strong and
remarkable.&mdash;&ldquo;The world (says he) grows worse and
worse.&nbsp; It is plain that men are much more covetous,
malicious, and resentful, much more unruly, shameless, and full
of vice, <a name="page628"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
628</span>than they were in the time of popery.&rdquo; <a
name="citation628a"></a><a href="#footnote628a"
class="citation">[628a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Formerly, when we were
suduced by the pope, men willingly followed good works, but now
all their study is to get every thing to themselves by exactions,
pillage, theft, lying, usury.&rdquo; <a
name="citation628b"></a><a href="#footnote628b"
class="citation">[628b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a wonderful thing,
and full of scandal, that from the time that the pure doctrine
was first called to light, the world should daily grow worse and
worse.&rdquo; <a name="citation628c"></a><a href="#footnote628c"
class="citation">[628c]</a>&mdash;The testimony of <span
class="smcap">Bucer</span>, another celebrated reformer, is to
the same effect.&nbsp; &ldquo;The greater part of the
people&rdquo; (says he) &ldquo;seem only to have embraced the
gospel, in order to shake off the yoke of discipline, and the
obligation of fasting, penance, &amp;c., which lay upon them in
the time of popery; and to live at their pleasure, enjoying their
lust and lawless appetites without controul.&nbsp; They therefore
lend a willing ear to the doctrine that we are <i>justified by
faith alone</i> and <i>not by good works</i>, having no relish
for them.&rdquo;&mdash;<a name="citation628d"></a><a
href="#footnote628d" class="citation">[628d]</a>&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Musculus</span> also, another eminent reformer, is
said to have borne much the same testimony. <a
name="citation628e"></a><a href="#footnote628e"
class="citation">[628e]</a></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Calvin&rsquo;s</span> evidence in this
case seems also to be equally forcible and decisive: &ldquo;Of so
many thousands (says he) seemingly eager in embracing the gospel,
how few have since amended their lives?&nbsp; Nay, to what else
does the greater part pretend, except by shaking off the heavy
yoke of superstition to launch out more freely into <a
name="page629"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 629</span>every kind
of lasciviousness?&rdquo; <a name="citation629a"></a><a
href="#footnote629a" class="citation">[629a]</a>&nbsp; Thus said
Calvin.&nbsp; When the character of the reformation is duly and
thoroughly considered, and especially that of Calvin&rsquo;s own
doctrine, it is no great wonder that such effects should
follow.&nbsp; It would have been much more wonderful if they had
not followed; at least, when we further consider the abominable
conduct, the vile and bloody deeds that were sanctioned by the
same reformer&rsquo;s own example.&nbsp; Had he been a different
sort of man, these unsightly fruits of his labours might have led
him to doubt the soundness of his faith, or suspect that his
creed did not altogether tally with the doctrine that is
according to godliness.&nbsp; But from him it could not be
expected.</p>
<p>Another testimony of no small weight in this case, and which
must not be here omitted, is that of the celebrated <span
class="smcap">Erasmus</span>, one of the greatest luminaries and
most eminent characters of that age, who has been reckoned among
the principal authors of the reformation as well as restorers of
literature.&nbsp; Let us listen then to his evidence on this
subject: &ldquo;What an <i>evangelical</i> generation is
this?&nbsp; Nothing was ever seen more licentious and more
seditious.&nbsp; Nothing is less <i>evangelical</i> than these
pretended <i>gospellers</i>. <a name="citation629b"></a><a
href="#footnote629b" class="citation">[629b]</a>&nbsp; Take
notice of this <i>evangelical</i> people, and shew me an
individual amongst them all who from being a drunkard has become
sober, from being <a name="page630"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
630</span>a libertine has become chaste.&nbsp; I, on the other
hand, can shew you many who have become worse by the
change.&nbsp; Those whom I once knew to have been chaste,
sincere, and without fraud, I found, after they had embraced this
sect, to be licentious in their conversation, gamblers,
neglectful of prayer, passionate, vain, as spiteful as serpents,
and lost to the feelings of human nature.&nbsp; I speak from
experience.&rdquo; <a name="citation630"></a><a
href="#footnote630" class="citation">[630]</a></p>
<p>Upon the whole, it seems impossible to evade the force of this
evidence, or deny that vice and immorality increased where
protestantism prevailed, and, consequently, that there must have
been some radical and essential defect in that system from the
very first: so that it must be the very height of folly,
absurdity, and arrogance in our present pretended evangelical
demagogues to attempt to hold it up to the people as a standard
of unadulterated truth and model of christian perfection.&nbsp;
It is remarkable enough that these good people, almost to a man,
are very loud in their reprobation of the French revolution,
although it might easily be proved that that same revolution was
nearly, if not quite as honourable in its origin, and respectable
in its progress as that which was excited and conducted by Martin
Luther, John Calvin, and their coadjutors, and which they seem so
much to admire, and so ready to commend and justify.&nbsp; While
reprobating the Gallic revolution on account of the
licentiousness and crimes it produced, they are not aware how
much the protestant revolution is liable to the same
imputation.</p>
<h4><a name="page631"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
631</span><span class="smcap">Section</span> II.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The former subject continued</i>, <i>with
occasional and brief remarks</i>.</p>
<p>There does not seem on any point a greater difference of
opinion between the admirers of the reformation and their
opponents than that which relates to the real character of the
reformers.&nbsp; Volumes have been written on both sides of the
question: one party extolling them to the skies, as if they had
been all perfect beings or angels of light, and the other
degrading them to the lowest point, as if they had been no better
than so many demons.&nbsp; Too much, no doubt, has been said both
for and against them.&nbsp; We must not believe them to be quite
so bad as some catholic writers have represented them; nor yet,
on the other hand, altogether so good and perfect as they have
been described by the generality of our protestant authors.&nbsp;
What is unfounded on either side we wish to explode; but some
apparently well established facts relating to the reformers, and
not generally known among protestants, ought not here to be
passed over unnoticed, as they are well calculated to correct the
reader&rsquo;s ideas, both as to the reformers and the
reformation.</p>
<p>As to Luther, it seems to be the common opinion among
protestants that he was convinced of the errors and corruptions
of the church of Rome, and, of course, decidedly hostile to them
before the appearance of <i>Tetzel</i> with his
indulgences.&nbsp; But this opinion appears to be
untenable.&nbsp; It is more likely that he had thought nothing
about the said errors and corruptions <a name="page632"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 632</span>before the arrival of that memorable
vender of pardons; and that either wholly out of detestation of
his extravagant and shameless pretensions, or partly also out of
spite to the Dominicans, to which order he belonged, he then
ventured to oppose that scandalous traffick, without any direct
intention to declare against any others of the papal
abominations, towards which it does not seem that he had yet
begun to conceive any aversion.</p>
<p>Accordingly, he appeared for some years after, to have no
mighty objection to any thing in the popish religion but the
<i>abuse</i> of the traffick of indulgences; and even on that
point he actually consented to observe in future a profound
silence, provided the same condition were imposed on his
adversaries.&nbsp; Nay he went still further, and proposed to
write a humble and submissive <i>Letter to the Pope</i>,
acknowledging that he had carried his zeal and animosity too far:
and such a Letter he actually did write.&nbsp; He even consented
to publish a <i>circular Letter</i>, exhorting all his disciples
and followers to reverence and obey all the dictates of the Roman
church.&nbsp; He declared that his only intention, in the
writings which he had composed was to brand with infamy those
emissaries who abused its authority, and employed its protection
as a mask to cover their abominable and impious frauds. <a
name="citation632"></a><a href="#footnote632"
class="citation">[632]</a></p>
<p>Such was the hostility to the pope and his cause, and such the
anxiety for religious reformation which Luther manifested for
some years after he had assumed the character of a reformer, or
rather after the commencement <a name="page633"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 633</span>of his quarrel with Tetzel and the
Dominicans.&nbsp; Had <i>Leo</i> X. been wise and politic enough
to accept his proffered submission, about the time of the
conferences with <i>Miltitz</i>, he would, to all appearance,
immediately and gladly have returned into the bosom of holy
church, and, most probably, never have given his holiness or the
world any further trouble on the score of religious abuses and
corruptions.</p>
<p>The haughty pontiff, however, instead of embracing the golden
opportunity, and receiving readily and kindly his rebellious, but
now repentant son, had recourse to the very opposite mode of
proceeding.&nbsp; He fulminated his anathemas against him, had
him solemnly excommunicated, declared an enemy to the church, and
even to the holy Roman empire.&nbsp; Luther having now no
alternative, was obliged to make virtue of necessity; and it is
easy to see that he was actually forced to take that course which
he afterwards pursued, and in the pursuit of which he displayed
such wonderful address, and such extraordinary talents as have
really immortalized his name.&nbsp; But as to real virtue, it
seems hard to see or say how much of that there was in his
opposition to the pope and church of Rome, except what is implied
in the law of selfpreservation.&nbsp; <i>Cromwell</i> too, had
that law on his side, to the full as much, perhaps, as Luther,
even while engaged in what has been deemed the most criminal
parts of his conduct, the dethronement of the king and attainment
of the supreme power.&nbsp; But which of these two men was the
most virtuous or most vicious, was the better or worse man, is a
point that <a name="page634"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
634</span>will not be presumed or attempted to be made here a
subject of investigation.&nbsp; They certainly had, both of them,
great talents and great defects.</p>
<p>Lutheran and other protestant writers have appeared not a
little anxious to have Luther acquitted from the imputation of
having opposed Tetzel out of spite to the Dominicans, or from
resentment for the preference shewn them in the distribution or
traffick of indulgences.&nbsp; We pretend not to say that that
was the <i>sole</i> cause of his opposition; but that it might be
<i>partly</i> the cause seems not at all improbable from what he
himself has owned on other occasions.&nbsp; Thus he acknowledges
that he had tried to persuade himself of there being no real
presence of Christ in the sacrament, &ldquo;on purpose <i>to
spite the pope</i>, but that the words of scripture were too
plain in favour of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Likewise, in his letter to
the Vaudois, he says, &ldquo;I have hitherto thought it of small
consequence whether the bread remains in the sacrament or not,
but now, <i>to spite the papists</i>, I am determined to believe
that it does remain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus also, writing against
those who had presumed to alter the public service without his
authority, he says, &ldquo;I knew very well that the elevation of
the sacrament was idolatrous, but 1 retained it <i>out of pure
spite to that devil Carlostadius</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation634"></a><a href="#footnote634"
class="citation">[634]</a>&nbsp; <a name="page635"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 635</span>A very glaring and most odious trait
in Luther&rsquo;s character was the ungentlemanly and foul
language in which he used to address his opponents, than which
nothing could be more unbecoming in one who pretended to be
engaged in, or anxious for the reformation of mankind, and the
revival or restoration of genuine and primitive
christianity.&nbsp; We have just now seen in what style he could
speak of his quondam friend Carlostadius: &ldquo;that
<i>devil</i> Carlostadius:&rdquo; and it seems he could be
sometimes equally uncivil and foulmouthed when he had occasion to
speak of <i>Zuinglius</i> and the rest of that party, who did not
receive his favourite doctrine of consubstantiation, or the real
presence; for whom he had no mercy, but consigned them all to
everlasting perdition; just as his modern disciples, our present
<i>evangelicals</i>, do to the poor Arians and Socinians.</p>
<p>As to the <i>papists</i>, it was not to be expected that he
should be more civil or polite to them than to the
Zuinglians.&nbsp; Accordingly, we are told that &ldquo;the usual
flowers of his speech, when addressing the pope and other
catholic prelates, were: villain, thief, traitor, apostle of the
devil, bishop of sodomites: and that the extent of his charity to
them was to wish that their bowels were torn out, that they were
cast into the Mediterranean sea or into the flames, and that they
were hurried away to the devil.&nbsp; His treatment of the king
of England, Henry VIII, with whom he had at one time a
theological controversy, (though afterwards they grew into a
better understanding with each other,) was not more respectful
than his treatment of the pope.&nbsp; Luther makes no <a
name="page636"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 636</span>difficulty
to call his royal antagonist, a Thomistical pig, an ass, a jakes,
a dunghill, the spawn of an adder, a basilisk, a lying buffoon
disguised in a king&rsquo;s robe, a mad fool with a frothy mouth
and a whorish face.&nbsp; He even addresses him as follows: You
lie, you stupid and sacrilegious king.&rdquo; <a
name="citation636a"></a><a href="#footnote636a"
class="citation">[636a]</a></p>
<p>Another very unamiable and disgustful trait in Luther&rsquo;s
character was his assuming an extraordinary and apostolic dignity
and authority, under the name or title of <i>Ecclesiastes</i>:
&ldquo;Martin Luther <i>Ecclesiastes</i> of
Wittemberg.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It is not fitting, (said he,)
that I should be without a <i>title</i>, having received the work
of the ministry, not from man, or by man, but by the gift of God,
and the revelation of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; <a
name="citation636b"></a><a href="#footnote636b"
class="citation">[636b]</a>&nbsp; This was evidently putting
himself upon a level, at least, with Peter and Paul, and the rest
of the apostles, and claiming from professing christians the
deference or submission due to them.&nbsp; Accordingly, &ldquo;he
plainly proclaims to the whole body of protestants, in case they
presume to consult together and determine about their common
belief, that he will return back to the ancient church, and
revoke every word he had ever written or taught against it;
telling them that even in acting right, when they acted without
his authority, they were plunging themselves into the jaws of
hell.&rdquo; <a name="citation636c"></a><a href="#footnote636c"
class="citation">[636c]</a></p>
<p><a name="page637"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 637</span>It is
not a little remarkable that this reformer pretended to have some
extraordinary intercourse, not only with the Deity, but also with
<i>Satan</i>.&nbsp; Accordingly, he has published to the world,
not only that he held frequent communications with the devil, but
also that he learned the most material part of the reformation,
namely, the abolition of the mass from him.&nbsp; In his treatise
on that subject there is an account of Satan&rsquo;s appearing to
him by night, and of a long dialogue that passed between them, in
which Luther defends the mass, and the devil argues against
it.&nbsp; The conclusion is that this new apostle yields to the
motives suggested by his internal antagonist, and adopts the
important reform which he proposes.&nbsp; We are also informed,
that Luther in one of his Sermons, according to <i>Cochleus</i>,
affirmed that he had &ldquo;eat more than a bushel of salt with
Satan;&rdquo; and that in his Colloquies he describes himself as
constantly haunted by the devil, who, he says, &ldquo;sleeps
nearer to me than my wife Catherine.&rdquo; <a
name="citation637"></a><a href="#footnote637"
class="citation">[637]</a></p>
<p>Luther bears testimony to the unfavourable effects of the
reformed religion, not only upon his followers, (as we have seen
before) but also upon <i>himself</i>.&nbsp; He says that whilst
he continued a catholic monk he observed <a
name="page638"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 638</span>chastity,
obedience and poverty; and that being free from worldly cares be
gave himself up to fasting, watching, and prayer: whereas, after
he commenced reformer, he describes himself as raging with the
most violent concupiscence, to satisfy which he broke through his
solemn vow of continency, in direct opposition to his former
doctrine, by marrying a religious woman, who was under the same
obligation.&nbsp; He then proceeded to teach what most people
deem shameful and licentious lessons, such as the permission, in
certain cases, of concubinage and polygamy, and that pestilential
doctrine, which is the utter destruction of all morality, that
there is no freedom in human actions&mdash;and that when the
scripture commands good works, &ldquo;we are to understand it to
forbid them, because we cannot do them; that a baptized person
cannot lose his soul, whatever sins he commit, provided he
believe, inasmuch as no sin can damn except infidelity.&rdquo; <a

<i>persecuting</i>, <i>and bloody spirit&mdash;the very first
thing whose reformation or expulsion they ought to have
attempted&mdash;its omission rendered their whole undertaking
illfavored</i>, <i>preposterous</i>, <i>and ineffectual</i>.</p>
<p>Defective in many parts as Luther&rsquo;s character really
was, he appears to have been, nevertheless, one of the <a
name="page639"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 639</span>best among
the original and leading reformers.&nbsp; There seemed to be a
frankness or unreservedness about him that was somewhat pleasing,
and which it is not easy to discover in many of his
coadjutors.&nbsp; He was also apparently not so bloodyminded as
some of them were, at whose head, it is presumed, we may venture
to place the apostle of Geneva, <i>Calvin</i>.&nbsp; This man (as
is evinced by the tragical case of <i>Servetus</i>,) when his
favourite dogmas were opposed, and his wisdom, learning, and
infallibility set at naught, nothing would satisfy but the
<i>obstruction</i> of his opponent: but Luther, (as appears from
the affair of Carlostadius,) would be pretty well satisfied with
the <i>banishment</i> only of those who happened so to offend
him.&nbsp; The spirit of Luther, however, though less vindictive
and diabolical than that of Calvin, was yet very dissimilar to
that of Jesus Christ, whose followers they both professed
themselves to be.</p>
<p>It seems to have been then the case, that those reformers who
had gone the furthest from the church of Rome in <i>doctrine</i>,
such as Calvin and the Swiss divines, who denied the real
presence, were yet the nighest to that church in <i>spirit</i>:
for they seemed more addicted to the practice of consigning to
destruction those whom they deemed heretics than the Lutherans,
though the latter did not depart near so far as the former from
the grand popish doctrine of <i>transubstantiation</i>.&nbsp; Odd
as this may be considered, it appears to be a fact; though to
account for it may, perhaps, be attended with considerable
difficulty.&nbsp; It cannot however, be supposed, that the denial
<a name="page640"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 640</span>of the
real presence could have any tendency to make people more
bloodthirsty, vindictive, or intolerant.</p>
<p>The reformers, in retaining the bigotry and intolerance, or
the <i>spirit</i> of popery, retained in fact its very worst
part, and what may be called its marrow and substance; which the
world had most need to get rid of.&nbsp; All therefore that they
did, or could do, in such a case, was only like giving a new
edition, or an abridgment of an old and bad work, which still
contained the essence of the former, and must, of course, have
the same defective and evil tendency.&nbsp; They appeared like
people undertaking the cure of a demoniac without casting out the
demon, or pretending that the evil or scrophula may be healed and
eradicated by the royal touch.&nbsp; In short, they began the
work at the wrong end, and never meddled with that part at which
they ought to have begun.</p>
<p>Their first work ought to have been to exhibit to the
religious world the meekness and gentleness of Christ, and
endeavour to bring those who professed to be his servants back to
the spirit of his religion.&nbsp; Had they done so, and
succeeded, their work would have beep more than half done.&nbsp;
The rest would have followed of course, or, at least, with little
comparative difficulty.&nbsp; For when men have once imbibed the
spirit of the New Testament, it will not be very hard to persuade
them to renounce such doctrines or practices as are not enjoined
or countenanced in that sacred volume: and if any errors or
misconceptions happen still to remain, they will <a
name="page641"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 641</span>become in a
great measure harmless, through the influence of that divine
spirit by which they are now led and governed.</p>
<p>The reformers in foisting into their system the impious and
horrid principle of intolerance and persecution, gave it a most
monstrous and shocking aspect, even more so than that of the
centaurs, or minotaurs of ancient fable; for it was like joining
God with the devil, or Christ with Belial.&nbsp; But nothing
better, perhaps, could be expected from men who knew so little of
the temper which christianity produces; and who never discerned
the difference between the wisdom that is from above and that
which is from beneath; or considered that Jesus Christ came not
to destroy men&rsquo;s lives, but to save them.&nbsp; For men who
knew so little of the genius of christianity to take it upon
them, as they did, to lord it over the faith of professing
christians, was certainly a most gross and iniquitous piece of
presumption.</p>
<p>The power which the reformers acquired was very great and
formidable, and the authority which they sometimes assumed and
exercised was not a little remarkable and extraordinary, as
appears not only from the permission of concubinage, &amp;c.
already mentioned, but also from the <i>Dispensation</i> granted
by Luther, Melancthon, Bucer, and five others, to the prince of
Hesse Cassel to have two wives at a time, and which was
afterwards published by a descendant of that prince.&nbsp; This
was certainly taking a great deal upon them, and placing
themselves, not indeed upon a level with the <a
name="page642"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 642</span>apostles,
as was before observed, but much above them, even with the pope
himself.&nbsp; Yet they seemed very angry with his holiness,
calling him antichrist, and many other bad names.&nbsp; They
appeared very desirous to pull him down, but had no manner of
objection to do his work, or act the pope themselves when it
suited them, and that was not unfrequently.</p>
<p>It is curious enough to hear these men inveigh against the
intolerant and persecuting spirit of the church of Rome, at the
very time when they themselves were manifesting the selfsame
spirit, and pursuing the same tyrannical and murderous course
which they so much condemned in the papists.&nbsp; In our own
country, John Fox, the martyrologist, was employed in writing
huge folios to describe the horrors of popish persecution, while
his own protestant sovereign and her bishops and clergy were
persecuting the poor puritans with unfeeling and relentless
rigour.&nbsp; Protestants can see the hatefulness of persecution
in the papists, but very often are quite blind to it in
themselves, or those of their own party. <a
name="citation642"></a><a href="#footnote642"
class="citation">[642]</a>&nbsp; They can discern what is bad in
their opponents, but overlook what is equally so in
themselves.</p>
<p><a name="page643"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
643</span>Christianity, in its first aspect and fundamental
principles, is a religion of peace and good will towards men,
which forbids any to domineer over their brethren, or exercise
authority over their consciences, and requires, in all things
whatsoever, to do to others as we would they should do to
us.&nbsp; But the reformers overlooked all this, and discovered
either an entire ignorance of, or a fixed aversion to these
godlike principles.&nbsp; In either case they must have been
wretchedly qualified to reform and christianize the world, or
form a religion worthy the reception of mankind.&nbsp; A
religion, however, they would and did form, and never rested till
they got it established by the civil power, and enforced by penal
sanctions; and this rendered its native intolerance doubly
pernicious and detestable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No religion&rdquo; (says an excellent writer)
&ldquo;can be established without penal sanctions, and all penal
sanctions in cases of religion are persecutions.&nbsp; Before a
man can persecute he must renounce the generous tolerant
dispositions of a christian.&nbsp; No religion can be established
without human creeds; and subscription to all human creeds
implies two dispositions contrary to true religion, <a
name="page644"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 644</span>and both
expressly forbidden by the author of it.&nbsp; These two
dispositions are, love of dominion over conscience in the
imposer, and an abject preference of slavery in the
subscriber.&nbsp; The first usurps the rights of Christ; the last
swears allegiance to a pretender.&nbsp; The first domineers, and
gives laws like a tyrant; the last truckles like a vassal.&nbsp;
The first assumes a dominion incompatible with his frailty,
impossible even to his dignity, yea even denied to the dignity of
angels; the last yields a low submission, inconsistent with his
own dignity, and ruinous to that very religion, which he pretends
by this mean to support.&rdquo; <a name="citation644"></a><a
href="#footnote644" class="citation">[644]</a></p>
<p>It is very remarkable, and no less true and disgusting, that
protestantism was ushered into the world in the very spirit of
the religion it strove to supplant.&nbsp; Yet its authors
expected to be thought commissioned by heaven to do what they
did, and clearly entitled to the gratitude and reverence of
mankind, as well as their ready submission to their dictates and
authority.&nbsp; But to one who has carefully examined the New
Testament, they appear so very different from the first
disseminators or propagators of christianity, that they can
hardly be supposed to belong to the same cause or family.&nbsp;
When <i>Luther</i> is seen <i>banishing</i> conscientious people
who differed from him, and <i>Calvin</i>, and the Swiss
reformers, <i>burning</i> or <i>hanging</i> them, and the French
protestants, or Calvinists of France solemnly soliciting their
popish sovereign to inflict severe punishment on those whom <a
name="page645"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 645</span>they were
pleased to deem heretics: <a name="citation645"></a><a
href="#footnote645" class="citation">[645]</a>&mdash;when one
recollects these acts, and that they were all done in the name of
the Lord, one is ready to sicken at the thought of the
pretensions of the actors, to reform the world and restore
christianity to its original state.&nbsp; Nor is it less
disgusting to hear our flaming advocates for modern orthodoxy
extolling these men, as models of christian sanctity, and
unexceptionable or safe guides to pure, undefiled, and
evangelical religion.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> IV.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Brief account of the rise and progress of
the reformation in this kingdom</i>.</p>
<p>No sooner had the reformation begun to gain ground and spread
on the continent than its effects began to be felt in this
country.&nbsp; The court, or government was at first so far from
being disposed to countenance it, that it seemed, on the
contrary, quite determined to oppose and crush it.&nbsp; The
sovereign himself appeared exceedingly hostile to it: which, from
his known character, must have rendered the prospect of its
admission and success here very dark and hopeless.&nbsp; So
inimical was <a name="page646"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
646</span>his majesty then to the cause of the reformers and so
hearty in that of their opponents, that he actually took up his
pen and wrote a book against Luther; for which important
performance and acceptable service the pope thought proper to
reward him, by conferring on him the dignified title of
<i>Defender of the Faith</i>; a title which all his
<i>protestant</i> successors have tenaciously, if not proudly
retained to this day.&nbsp; This was the book which Luther
answered in the rude and uncourtly manner before described. <a
name="citation646"></a><a href="#footnote646"
class="citation">[646]</a></p>
<p>Our royal polemic did not long continue to be that fond and
dutiful son of his holy father at Rome of which he had at first
exhibited so fair and hopeful a promise.&nbsp; His Holiness not
readily favouring his inclination, or gratifying his wish to be
divorced from his first wife and marry another Lady, whom he
liked much better, he disdainfully threw off that paternal yoke,
renounced his connection with Rome, and became himself a great
and violent reformer; so as to deserve to be placed in the very
first rank among his contemporaries of that denomination.&nbsp; A
mighty revolution ensued throughout his dominions: and though we
cannot boast of the purity of the source whence it sprung, or of
its being distinguished, (at least in the outset,) by much, if
any, real virtue; yet it proved eventually of no small advantage
and benefit to these nations: and Henry ought to be commemorated
as one of the chief and most meritorious of all our royal
benefactors.</p>
<p><a name="page647"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 647</span>One
of the chief objects of Henry&rsquo;s reformation, like that of
Lather, seems to have been to <i>spite the pope</i>.&nbsp; He had
also in view, no doubt, the gratification of his ambition and
caprice, which in a mind like his must have been very powerful
springs of action.&nbsp; Nor did he miss his aims: he fairly
expelled the pope, obtained full scope for his caprice, boundless
as it was, and actually acquired far more power than ever, for he
now became a complete and uncontrouled despot in temporal, and a
pope in spiritual affairs.&nbsp; The two other branches of the
legislature, from whom alone any effectual or legal opposition
could have arisen, were so far from daring or attempting to check
his soaring career, or cross his capricious humour, that they
readily and obsequiously concurred in constituting him supreme
head both of church and state.</p>
<p>Having reached the utmost point of elevation, or pinnacle of
power, he set about reforming the religion, and rectifying the
faith of his subjects, after the example of his brother-reformers
on the continent; and a most curious, grotesque, and strange
piece of work he certainly made of it.&nbsp; Yet it is supposed
to be the true foundation or groundwork of our present national
establishment, and that Henry himself was the father, or first
patriarch of the English protestant Hierarchy.&nbsp; Nor has our
established church any just ground or reason, apparently, to
disown him in that character, for he was perhaps as holy and good
a soul as most of her succeeding patriarchs.&nbsp; But this point
we pretend not to determine.</p>
<p><a name="page648"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 648</span>King
Henry made his own faith or creed the standard or model for all
his subjects, male and female, young and old, learned and
unlearned.&nbsp; It was at the utmost peril of any of his
subjects if their religion did not exactly tally with his; at
least, if he happened to find it out.&nbsp; If shorter or
narrower than his, it was at the peril of their lives; and the
same again if it proved longer or broader.&nbsp; It must not vary
a single inch, or even a hair&rsquo;s breadth from his, or his
majesty would deem it a most grievous offence, and a crime
deserving capital punishment.&nbsp; Hence he is known to have put
some to death for <i>not</i> going so far from Rome or popery as
he did, and some again for <i>going</i> further; and both were
occasionally burnt in the same fire, or at the same time.&nbsp;
In short, it was then a sad and dismal time in this country, and
Henry&rsquo;s reformation must have been a most strange and
terrible work.</p>
<p>Even the bishops and other religious functionaries, who
generally fare better than most other people, could not then have
a very pleasant time of it; especially the better sort of them,
who could have wished to lead honest lives and act somewhat
conscientiously, had they been quietly permitted so to do.&nbsp;
To that class bishop <i>Latimer</i> is supposed to belong.&nbsp;
He seemed more simple and downright than most of the rest, which
might involve him in difficulties which his more wary brethren
would naturally escape.&nbsp; Accordingly we find the correctness
of his creed repeatedly called in question, and he got frequently
into heretical scrapes, which he generally <a
name="page649"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 649</span>managed to
get out of by abjuration: <a name="citation649"></a><a
href="#footnote649" class="citation">[649]</a>&mdash;a method
which some would be apt to deem not very creditable to his virtue
or integrity, though in general looked upon as unimpeachable and
of the first order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Admitting him&rdquo; (says Milner to Sturges) &ldquo;to
have been conscientiously persuaded of the truth of the
Reformation, was it consistent with christian integrity and
virtue to dissemble his religion for twenty years together, and
repeatedly abjure it, as he certainly did as often as he found
himself threatened with any serious danger by adhering to
it?&nbsp; Was it consistent with integrity and virtue to accept
of one of the highest offices, the bishopric of Worcester, in a
church which he so much reprobated, and even to take an oath of
opposing, to the utmost of his power, all persons who dissented
from, or were <a name="page650"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
650</span>disobedient to it?&nbsp; But supposing you inclined to
overlook all this, what will you say to the share he took in the
religious persecutions both of Henry&rsquo;s and of
Edward&rsquo;s reign?&nbsp; What excuse will you make for him
when you find him sending christians and protestants to the stake
for the very opinion which he himself holds?&rdquo; <a
name="citation650"></a><a href="#footnote650"
class="citation">[650]</a>&nbsp; These are serious charges, and
all apparently well-founded; but the chief and heaviest of them
is his being a bloody persecutor.&nbsp; He was moreover one of
our chief English reformers, on which account the above brief
sketch of his character has been here introduced, along with the
rest of his most conspicuous associates, to give the reader an
opportunity to judge what veneration is due to their memory, or
how well or ill they deserved of their contemporaries and of
posterity.</p>
<p><i>Ridley</i> is another of our protestant prelates that
appeared at the head of our English Reformation.&nbsp; Dr.
<i>Sturges</i> describes him as &ldquo;active in the conduct of
ecclesiastical affairs.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which his keen and able
opponent replies: &ldquo;I think, sir, you will grant that he
shewed rather too much activity in these affairs, to be
consistent with integrity, after I shall have reminded you, that
when bishop of Rochester in Henry&rsquo;s days, and when bishop
of London in those of Edward, he was as forward in persecuting
protestants and anabaptists as <a name="page651"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 651</span>Cranmer, Latimer, and the rest of
the prelates were; and that he was one of the most zealous and
forward of Dudley&rsquo;s partisans in endeavouring to interrupt
the regular succession of the throne, and in raising that
rebellion which was attended with the loss of so much
blood.&rdquo; <a name="citation651"></a><a href="#footnote651"
class="citation">[651]</a></p>
<p><i>Hooper</i>, another of our chief reformers, was much less
active than Ridley in the conduct of ecclesiastical
affairs.&nbsp; He was somewhat scrupulous about certain vestments
and ceremonies; and he might have some scruples too on the
subject of persecution: at least it is not in the present
writer&rsquo;s recollection that he was very forward, like the
others, in harassing those who were called heretics.&nbsp; His
character, however, seems not so indefectible as to entitle him
to be held up as a mirror of evangelical soundness, or an object
of universal admiration.&nbsp; He has been charged with being the
founder of the sect called <i>puritans</i>, which proved so
troublesome to our rulers in church and state for a whole century
or more: but this is not mentioned here as a blemish in his
character.&nbsp; The following circumstances are of a more
blamable nature: 1.&nbsp; His obtaining and holding the bishopric
of Worcester, in addition to his former bishopric of Gloucester,
after having inveighed very strongly in his sermons against
pluralities: 2.&nbsp; His consenting to wear the vestments, after
having engaged the young king to write to Cranmer that they
&ldquo;were offensive to his conscience;&rdquo; and his taking
the oath of supremacy, after <a name="page652"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 652</span>having made his patron, Dudley,
write to the same prelate that &ldquo;it was burdensome to his
conscience,&rdquo; when he found that he could not get promotion
otherwise. <a name="citation652a"></a><a href="#footnote652a"
class="citation">[652a]</a></p>
<p>But in our English reformation, under Henry VIII, and Edward
VI, the chief agent was confessedly archbishop <i>Cranmer</i>,
whose character, as exhibited by eminent protestant writers,
abounded with great and glaring blemishes.&nbsp; &ldquo;The first
remarkable circumstance we meet in the life of Cranmer is his
privately marrying a woman of low condition, whilst he was fellow
of Jesus College, Cambridge, <a name="citation652b"></a><a
href="#footnote652b" class="citation">[652b]</a> contrary to the
engagements of his admission.&nbsp; He afterwards, when a priest,
[and while his first wife was alive] married a second wife in
Germany, by a much more flagrant violation of his vow of
celibacy, and having brought her privately into England, he
continued to live with her, in equal opposition to the laws of
the church and of the land,&rdquo; [and though he had assured the
king that he had sent her home to Germany.]&nbsp; &ldquo;Being a
Lutheran in principle, as far back as the year 1529, he
afterwards accepted the office of pope&rsquo;s penitentiary, and
when named to the archbishopric of Canterbury he was content to
accept different bulls from the pontiff to take upon himself the
character of his legate in England, and even to make a solemn
oath of obedience to him, <a name="citation652c"></a><a
href="#footnote652c" class="citation">[652c]</a> with an
obligation of opposing all heretics and schismatics, that is to
say, according to the received sense of the words, all persons of
his own religious persuasion.&nbsp; <a name="page653"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 653</span>In like manner he must have said
mass, which, in his opinion, was an idolatrous worship, both at
his consecration, and frequently at other times, during the
fourteen years that he governed the church of England under
Henry.&nbsp; He must also necessarily, from time to time, have
ordained other priests to perform the same worship, and imposed
upon them the obligation of that continency which he himself did
not observe.&nbsp; In a word, we see his subscription still
affixed to a great variety of doctrinal articles and injunctions,
issued during that reign, which we know to have been in direct
opposition to his real sentiments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one knows that Cranmer owed his rise in the
church to the part which he took in Henry&rsquo;s divorce from
queen Catherine of Arragon.&nbsp; Henry tired out with the
opposition of Rome, and impatient to be united with his beloved
Ann Boleyn, privately marries her Nov. 14, 1532, and Cranmer
himself is one of the witnesses of the contract. <a
name="citation653a"></a><a href="#footnote653a"
class="citation">[653a]</a>&nbsp; On the 11th. of the following
March this same prelate writes a letter to Henry, from
&ldquo;pure motives of conscience&rdquo; as he declares, <a
name="citation653b"></a><a href="#footnote653b"
class="citation">[653b]</a> but from a preconcerted scheme as the
fact proves, representing the necessity there was of determining
the long depending cause between him and his queen, and demanding
of him the necessary ecclesiastical jurisdiction to decide it. <a
name="citation653c"></a><a href="#footnote653c"
class="citation">[653c]</a>&nbsp; This being granted, he on the
20th of May pronounces a sentence of divorce between the royal
pair, and authorises Henry to take another wife; <a
name="citation653d"></a><a href="#footnote653d"
class="citation">[653d]</a> six months <a
name="page654"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 654</span>after he
himself had officiated as witness to his marriage with Ann
Boleyn, and only four months before the latter was delivered of
an infant who was afterwards queen Elizabeth. <a
name="citation654a"></a><a href="#footnote654a"
class="citation">[654a]</a>&nbsp; What a scandalous collusion in
so important a matter of conscience and public
example!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In less than three years however [his sacred majesty]
grows weary of the consort whom he had moved heaven and earth to
gain, <a name="citation654b"></a><a href="#footnote654b"
class="citation">[654b]</a> and becomes enamoured of a new
beauty.&nbsp; Nevertheless appearances must be saved; and
therefore Cranmer presents himself as the ready instrument in
smoothing the way to the gratification of [his sovereign&rsquo;s]
passions.&nbsp; After a feint effort to save Ann, <a
name="page655"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 655</span>to whose
family he had such infinite obligations, in a cold adulatory
letter to the king, which he wrote on the occasion, <a
name="citation655a"></a><a href="#footnote655a"
class="citation">[655a]</a> he lent all his aid to ruin and
oppress her, permitting, if not persuading, her, (standing as she
then did upon the verge of eternity) to confess what he knew to
be false; <a name="citation655b"></a><a href="#footnote655b"
class="citation">[655b]</a> and pronouncing a sentence of
divorce, which contained that she had never been <i>validly
married to Henry</i>, at the very time when she was lying under
sentence of death for violating his bed by adultery!&rdquo; <a
name="citation655c"></a><a href="#footnote655c"
class="citation">[655c]</a></p>
<p>In the transactions relating to Ann of Cleves, Henry&rsquo;s
fourth queen, Cranmer&rsquo;s conduct appears scarcely less
dishonourable than in those relating to Ann Boleyn.&nbsp; Nor
does it seem that the death of Henry produced in him any real or
material amendment: so that there can be no validity in the
excuse usually made for his former misconduct by ascribing it
chiefly to that monarch&rsquo;s despotic will.&nbsp; He appeared
just as obsequious to the will of the protector Seymour as he had
been before to that of Henry.&nbsp; &ldquo;To gratify this he
consented to set aside in a great measure the last will of his
old master, of which he was the first-named executor. <a
name="citation655d"></a><a href="#footnote655d"
class="citation">[655d]</a>&nbsp; Having raised this
ecclesiastical no less than civil idol to undue power, he was
ready to pay homage to him with all the essential authority of
the church, taking out a new commission <a
name="page656"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 656</span>for his
archbishopric, under the pretext that his former power had
expired with the deceased king, and professing to be a prelate no
longer than the child Edward, or rather Seymour himself, should
acknowledge him to be so.&rdquo; <a name="citation656a"></a><a
href="#footnote656a" class="citation">[656a]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Cranmer concurred no less in other [misdoings] and
disorders of this infant reign, than he did in those stated
above.&nbsp; He gratified Somerset by subscribing to the death
warrant of his brother.&nbsp; He was afterwards as forward as any
of the other courtiers in paying his homage to the rising power
of Dudley, when he found the interest of the latter growing
stronger than that of Seymour: and he carried his ingratitude to
his deceased benefactor Henry, and his infidelity in the
discharge of that prince&rsquo;s last will, to such a length as
to concur in excluding his two daughters from their lawful
inheritance and right to the crown, in order to place it on the
head of Dudley&rsquo;s daughter-in-law, the lady Jane.&nbsp; If
Elizabeth [therefore] had succeeded to the throne immediately
after Edward, she would no more have spared Cranmer and Ridley
than Mary did.&rdquo; <a name="citation656b"></a><a
href="#footnote656b" class="citation">[656b]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;In conclusion, if Cranmer was <i>burnt</i> to death for
heresy, instead of being beheaded for rebellion, [his advocates
ought to] reflect, how many persons he himself, whilst he had
power in his hands, had condemned to this punishment, on the
selfsame accusation.&rdquo;&nbsp; For it is undeniable that be
was instrumental in the execution <a name="page657"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 657</span>of many persons for religions
opinions, and that some of them held the very tenets for which he
himself afterwards suffered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though this part of his
conduct has keen kept out of sight as much as possible, yet we
have certain proofs of his having been one of the chief
instruments, under Henry, in bringing to the stake John Lambert,
Ann Askew, John Frith, and William Allen, <a
name="citation657a"></a><a href="#footnote657a"
class="citation">[657a]</a> for denying the real presence of
Christ in the sacrament, besides a great number of anabaptists,
&amp;c. for their respective opinions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the reign of Edward VI, besides other most severe
persecutions which he carried on against Gospellers, Anabaptists,
and other sectaries, amongst whom two at least were
Sacramentarians, he was the active promoter and immediate cause
of the burning of Joan Knell, <a name="citation657b"></a><a
href="#footnote657b" class="citation">[657b]</a> and George Paris
or Van Parr, <a name="citation657c"></a><a href="#footnote657c"
class="citation">[657c]</a> for certain <a
name="page658"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 658</span>singular
opinions.&nbsp; Amongst those who escaped with their lives, a
great part of them were forced to recant, through the fear of
torments, and to carry lighted tapers and faggots, in testimony
of their having merited burning. <a name="citation658a"></a><a
href="#footnote658a" class="citation">[658a]</a>&nbsp; As to the
fate of Joan Knell, or Butcher, commonly called Joan of Kent,
(and whose innocent blood was evidently shed by the procurement
of Cranmer,) Dr. Milner thinks that when it is considered with
all its attendant circumstances, a more cruel and wanton act of
persecution (he might have said <i>murder</i>,) is not to be
found upon record. <a name="citation658b"></a><a
href="#footnote658b" class="citation">[658b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;The
doctrine for which she suffered (he adds) was of an abstract
nature, not calculated to gain proselytes or to occasion any
public disturbances.&nbsp; <a name="page659"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 659</span>She was barely accused of
maintaining, that &ldquo;Christ passed through the blessed
Virgin&rsquo;s body as water through a conduit, without
participating of that body through which he passed.&rdquo; <a
name="citation659a"></a><a href="#footnote659a"
class="citation">[659a]</a>&nbsp; For no other cause than
persisting in this opinion, she was convented in the church of
St. Paul, before archbishop Cranmer and his assistants, convicted
and delivered over to the secular arm.&nbsp; We have the sentence
that he pronounced on the occasion, which is rigorous beyond the
usual terms; and we have a certificate of it, addressed to the
king, in which instead of petitioning for mercy, in the usual
style of such instruments, the convict heretic is expressly
recommended &ldquo;to receive due punishment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor is
this all, for the royal youth being unwilling to sign the warrant
for her execution, Cranmer employs all his theological arguments
to induce him to comply; amongst other things telling him that
&ldquo;princes, being God&rsquo;s deputies, ought to punish
impieties against God.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the end Edward sets his
hand to the warrant, but with tears in his eyes, telling Cranmer,
that &ldquo;if he did wrong, he (the said Cranmer) should answer
for it to God.&rdquo;&nbsp; At length, by a change in
circumstances, the archbishop himself being condemned as a
heretic to suffer that cruel death, to which he had condemned so
many others on the same account, &ldquo;he was far from imitating
the firmness of the greater part of them.&rdquo; <a
name="citation659b"></a><a href="#footnote659b"
class="citation">[659b]</a></p>
<p>His recantation of his former or protestant principles, at
Mary&rsquo;s accession, is well known.&nbsp; The prevailing <a
name="page660"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 660</span>notion is,
that it was the effect of &ldquo;a momentary weakness,&rdquo; or
the act and deed of &ldquo;an unguarded hour:&rdquo; but that
appears very far from being correct or true.&nbsp; On the
contrary, &ldquo;he is proved to have deliberately subscribed six
different forms of recantation, at so many different periods, <a
name="citation660a"></a><a href="#footnote660a"
class="citation">[660a]</a> each one of which was more ample and
express than the preceding one; and he remained during the whole
five or six last weeks of his life, and until the very hour of
his death, either a sincere catholic or an egregious
hypocrite.&nbsp; At length finding that, notwithstanding so many
retractations, he was upon the point of being executed, he
revoked them all, and shewed a resolution at his death which he
had exhibited in no one occurrence of his life.&rdquo; <a

<p class="gutsumm"><i>View of the first fruits of the English
reformation</i>, <i>or its immediate and subsequent effects on
the public manners and morals&mdash;system
defective&mdash;reasons for introducing these subjects into this
work</i>.</p>
<p>We have seen already what were the first fruits, or immediate
effects of the continental reformation; and as our own
reformation was only the counterpart of that, or, as we might
say, its offspring, it was hardly to be expected but that the
effects or fruits of both would be similar.&nbsp; We accordingly
meet with undeniable evidence <a name="page661"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 661</span>that that was really the case.&nbsp;
Among those competent witnesses who describe the effects of the
reformation in this kingdom, the first place or first hearing, no
doubt, is due to that memorable prince who laid the foundation of
it, Henry VIII.&nbsp; His majesty speaks very plainly and
pointedly upon this subject, in a speech which he delivered to
parliament the year before his death.&nbsp; Having then
complained of the abuse which the people made of the permission
he had granted them to read the scriptures in the vulgar tongue,
by &ldquo;their own phantastical opinions and vain
expositions,&rdquo; instead of consulting him their spiritual
head, he goes on: &ldquo;I am sure that charitie was never so
faint amongst you, and vertuous and godlie living was never less,
nor God himselfe amongst christians was never less reverenced,
honored, or served.&rdquo; <a name="citation661"></a><a
href="#footnote661" class="citation">[661]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;That the state of morality was not rendered better, but
rather infinitely worse, in the following reign, when the
protestant religion was fully developed and established, we have
abundant and undeniable evidence in the confessions of the most
zealous advocates and abettors of that cause.&nbsp; The following
is <i>bishop Burnet&rsquo;s</i> account of the state of morality
under Edward VI: &ldquo;The sins of England did at that time call
down from heaven heavy curses on the land.&nbsp; They are sadly
expressed in a discourse that <i>Ridley</i> wrote soon after,
under the title of <i>The Lamentation of England</i>: he says
that &ldquo;lechery, oppression, pride, covetousness, and a
hatred and scorn <a name="page662"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
662</span>of all religion were generally spread amongst all
people, but chiefly those of the higher ranks.&rdquo; <a
name="citation662a"></a><a href="#footnote662a"
class="citation">[662a]</a></p>
<p>Ridley&rsquo;s fellow-bishop, <i>Latimer</i>, speaks still
more openly as to one particular vice, in a sermon preached
before the king, and quoted by Heylin.&nbsp; His words are these:
&ldquo;Lechery is used in England, and such lechery as is used in
no other part of the world.&nbsp; And it is made a matter of
sport, a trifle not to be passed on or reformed.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
remedy this he begs that the church may be reinstated in
&ldquo;her right of excommunicating notable offenders, by putting
them out of the congregation.&rdquo; <a
name="citation662b"></a><a href="#footnote662b"
class="citation">[662b]</a>&nbsp; In another of his court sermons
he seems to glance at corruption in high places or
offices&mdash;such as judges taking bribes: &ldquo;I would
wish,&rdquo; (says he) &ldquo;that of such a judge in England now
we might have the skin hanged up.&nbsp; It were a goodly sight,
the sign of the judge&rsquo;s skin.&rdquo; <a
name="citation662c"></a><a href="#footnote662c"
class="citation">[662c]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The laborious collector <i>Strype</i>, though a most
zealous advocate for the cause of the reformation, yet draws the
most frightful picture of the wickedness which prevailed
throughout the nation after its first establishment that is to be
met with in history.&nbsp; The account is too long to be here
inserted at length, but it is comprised under the following
heads: &ldquo;The covetousness of the nobility and gentry; the
oppression of the poor; no redress at law; the judges ready to
barter justice for money; impunity of murders; the clergy very
bad from the bishops to the curates; and above all, the increase
of <a name="page663"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
663</span>adulteries and whoredom. <a name="citation663a"></a><a
href="#footnote663a" class="citation">[663a]</a>&nbsp; The
historian <i>Camden&rsquo;s</i> description of these times agrees
with that of the former writers.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;The
sacrilegious avarice of the times rapaciously seized upon
colleges, chantries, and hospitals, under the pretence of
superstition: whilst ambition and jealousy amongst the great, and
insolence and sedition amongst the people, swelled to such a
pitch that England seemed to be raging mad with rebellions,
tumults, party zeal, &amp;c.&rdquo; <a name="citation663b"></a><a
href="#footnote663b" class="citation">[663b]</a></p>
<p>During the reign of Elizabeth, when Camden wrote, and when the
reformation had arrived at full maturity, though the civil state
of the realm was better regulated, yet in private life, as Dr.
Milner observes, &ldquo;the vices of individuals in every rank
rose to the same height of profligacy as before.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
corroboration of this he refers to contemporary protestant
testimonies.&nbsp; <i>Stubbs</i>, the author of a piece entitled
&ldquo;Motives to Good Works,&rdquo; with an epistle dedicatorie
to the lord major of London, an. 1596, asserts, among other
things, that the observation of Luther, (quoted above, p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page628">628</a></span>,) still
holds good: and he further says; &ldquo;For good works who sees
not that they (the papists of former times) were far beyond us,
and we far behind them.&rdquo; p. 44.&nbsp; To the same effect
speaks <i>R. Jeffery</i>, in his sermon at Paul&rsquo;s Cross,
an. 1604.&nbsp; Many other writers, particularly of the puritan
party, have given similar testimonies in reference <a
name="page664"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 664</span>to the
reign both of Elizabeth and also of her successor James. <a
name="citation664"></a><a href="#footnote664"
class="citation">[664]</a></p>
<p>From the preceding facts or premises we may venture to affirm
that the effects of the reformation on those who first embraced
it were not such as might be expected, <a
name="page665"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 665</span>or such as
would have appeared, had the religion which the reformers
introduced been of divine origin, or the same with that which the
apostles promulgated, and which is contained in the New
Testament.&nbsp; The latter, like a good tree, produced good
fruit; and its effects, wherever it prevailed, or was heartily
received, were very different from those above described, and of
the very opposite character.&nbsp; It must follow therefore, that
the religion of the reformers was so radically and materially
defective as not to be adapted to answer some of the chief or
most important ends which the religion of Christ was designed to
promote&mdash;and even that its whole scope and tendency were
actually subversive of those very ends.</p>
<p>This will not appear very wonderful when it is considered what
manner of spirit the reformers were of, or how their religion was
constituted, and that they appear to have paid far more attention
to the sayings and dictates of Athanasius and Jerom, Ambrose and
Austin, and the rest of those old women called <i>fathers</i>,
than they did to those of the apostles and evangelists, or even
of Jesus Christ himself.&nbsp; Nothing therefore very good and
excellent could be expected from them; nor indeed any thing
superior to, or better than such a farrago as they did produce,
or such articles, creeds, confessions, directories, formulas,
&amp;c. as they thought proper to impose on their disciples and
followers.&nbsp; To have produced what was right good, and
excellent, they must have drawn from a purer fountain, and
partaken of another and very different spirit.</p>
<p><a name="page666"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 666</span>The
reformation being destitute of the spirit of christianity, and
full of that of popery, which constituted its grand defect, it
could not possibly prove that blessing to mankind which it
otherwise would have done.&nbsp; It usurped the same dominion
over conscience as the old religion did, and persecuted with
equal bitterness and violence those who dared to think and judge
for themselves, and refused to yield obedience to its authority,
or submit to its usurpation.&nbsp; It is difficult therefore to
see on what that mighty reverence claimed for the names and
memory of the reformers can be founded.&nbsp; Had they actually
published and granted liberty of conscience to the people, and
allowed every honest man to think and judge for himself, and to
serve and worship God according to the conviction of his own
mind&mdash;then, indeed, might love and gratitude and reverence
be justly claimed to their memory, and their names be enrolled
among the best and most eminent benefactors of their
species.&nbsp; But such was not their conduct.&mdash;In fine,
considering the spirit which they breathed and the effects which
their doctrines produced, it seems impossible to look upon them
as promoters of the religion of the New Testament, or
promulgators of the genuine gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>But it may, and probably will be asked, Why introduce these
subjects into the present work?&nbsp; To this we beg leave to
answer: 1.&nbsp; Because they are in general ill understood, and
supposed to be so by many who will probably peruse these sheets,
to whom an attempt to place them in a right and true light would
be, as it was thought, a reasonable and acceptable
service.&mdash;<a name="page667"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
667</span>2.&nbsp; Because we are now entering upon that part of
the work which commences at the reformation, in which of course,
many things will occur which have resulted from that event; an
introductory sketch of which therefore seemed necessary for the
right conception or illustration of such
occurrences.&mdash;3.&nbsp; Because the discussion of these
subjects here will enable the reader to perceive the living image
and offspring of the original reformers in those of the present
day who assume the character of <i>evangelical</i>, and sole
promoters of <i>vital</i> religion.&nbsp; Their <i>principles</i>
and <i>spirit</i> evince the stock whence they are sprung: and so
also do those <i>filial feelings</i> so very visible in their
readiness at all times to defend or palliate the very worst
actions of those reformers, and even the murderous deeds of a
Calvin and a Cranmer.&mdash;4 Because it afforded the author an
opportunity to bear his testimony against some of the greatest
existing evils that have sprung from the reformation, bigotry and
intolerance; which have ever since, even in this protestant
country and town, and among most of our tolerated sects, usurped
the place of religious liberty, and trampled upon the sacred
rights of conscience.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> VI.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Further remarks on the effects of the
Reformation</i>, <i>especially as they appeared in this
town</i>.</p>
<p>The effects of the reformation were very great and remarkable,
not only on those who were rationally proselyted to it, or who
received it upon conviction, but also <a name="page668"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 668</span>on them who went with the tide
without exercising their reason or troubling their heads at all
about the comparative merits of the two religions.&nbsp; Neither
party had their morals improved, but on the contrary rendered
much more dissolute by the change, as we have already seen.&nbsp;
The same event had likewise effects no less visible and
remarkable on the very aspect or appearance of both town and
country; as must necessarily have been the case from the
dissolution and demolition of so many religious houses, and the
suppression and expulsion of such a multitude of monks, friars,
and nuns, who must have had no small influence in preserving
social order, regulating the morals, and restraining many of the
vicious propensities of the community.</p>
<p>In fact, the licentiousness which appears to have resulted
from the reformation is seemingly to be ascribed to the three
following causes&mdash;1. The real, apparent, or supposed loose
tendency of certain leading doctrines of the reformers, as was
observed before.&mdash;2. The suppression of the religious
houses, whose inhabitants used to be the means of promoting
public decency, and checking the influence of licentious
principles. <a name="citation668"></a><a href="#footnote668"
class="citation">[668]</a>&mdash;3. The revolutionary character
of the reformation.&nbsp; All great revolutions, from their very
nature, tend to weaken the ties, and loosen the bands which
preserve the good order of society and strengthen the moral
habits of its members.&mdash;It may be reasonably concluded that
each of these causes had a material effect on this <a
name="page669"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 669</span>town and
country at the memorable era of reformation, and long after.</p>
<p>We can discover no appearance or indication that the character
or disposition of the Lynn people was further christianized,
mollified, or any way improved by that extraordinary event; but
rather the contrary.&nbsp; Among the principal transactions left
upon record as having taken place here since the reformation, one
of the first is &ldquo;the burning of a Dutchman in the Market
place for heresy.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is said to have happened in
the year 1335, and so at an early period of our
protestantism.&nbsp; It is remarkable enough that the only
instance that occurred in this town of putting a man to death for
heresy, or burning him for his religion, happened after the
reformation, or since the town became protestant; which shews
that people may bear that honourable name and at the same time be
very far from humanity and righteousness.</p>
<p>The poor hapless sufferer had probably fled to England and
made choice of Lynn as a place of refuge from the persecution
which then raged in his own country.&nbsp; He might be induced to
take this step from the favourable reports he had heard at home
of the generosity and hospitality of our nation towards
strangers, and particularly the oppressed and friendless.&nbsp;
If such was actually the case, he found himself at last miserably
disappointed, and learnt by dear bought and bitter experience,
that however abundant the liberality and tender mercies of
England and of Lynn might be towards some descriptions of
oppressed or distressed people, yet that <a
name="page670"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 670</span>they by no
means extended to those called <i>heretics</i>:&mdash;an
appellation which has too often meant no more than that those
branded with it differed from the ruling or predominant party,
and were consigned by them to the ill opinion and detestation of
the public.</p>
<p>The deplorable fate of this friendless stranger must stamp
indelible disgrace on the memory of his brutal murderers? and it
shews what little reason Lynn then had to congratulate itself on
its change from popery to protestantism.&nbsp; We have no account
what the dreadful heresy was, with which this unpitied victim to
protestant bigotry and persecution was charged, and for which he
suffered.&nbsp; Whatever it was, it could not be very dangerous
or alarming; for as he was a foreigner there could be no danger
of his disseminating it here among a people of whose language he
can be supposed to have little or no knowledge.&nbsp; In short,
every feeling heart must be shocked at the aggravated atrocity of
this diabolical deed.</p>
<p>It is sad and mortifying enough to think how much this town
has been under the influence of religious bigotry and
intolerance, and the most pitiful narrowmindedness almost ever
since.&nbsp; The harmless <i>Quakers</i> were here imprisoned and
cruelly treated, and the <i>Baptists</i> were harassed in the
most unjust and shameful manner even after the revolution.&nbsp;
Poor creatures, most wrongfully branded with the odious name of
<i>witches</i>, were here also for no short period since the
reformation, subjected to rigorous prosecutions and capital
punishments.&nbsp; These facts are now just glanced at, but shall
be more fully related hereafter in the course of the work.</p>
<p><a name="page671"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
671</span>Unfavourable as some of the reformed doctrines
undoubtedly were to moral improvement, it cannot be said to be
the case with all of them.&nbsp; Some were evidently of the
opposite tendency, as were also some of the romish
doctrines.&nbsp; But they could not be expected to produce the
desired effect unless they were extensively promulgated; and that
does not appear to have been the case in this country, at least
till a long while after the commencement of the
reformation.&nbsp; It was one of the great and glaring defects of
the reforming system in England, that it did not provide a
sufficient number of religious or public instructors in lieu of
those of the old religion who had been suppressed and silenced at
the dissolution of the monasteries and other religious houses, or
in consequence of their aversion to the new order of
things.&nbsp; These are known to have been very numerous, but the
number of the reformed ministers, or protestant clergy, who were
appointed to succeed them and supply their places as public
instructors, appears to have been very inconsiderable;
comparatively at least: and, what is not a little remarkable,
they were also, for the most part, far less competent than their
predecessors for the charge they undertook.&nbsp; In such
circumstances, and with such a ministry, it might be expected
that vice and licentiousness would increase and abound.</p>
<p>The state of things at Lynn, at, and long after the
reformation, does not appear to have been at all favourable to
moral and religious improvement.&nbsp; Before that period the
town abounded with religious and moral instructors, <a
name="page672"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 672</span>such as
they were, who certainly contributed in no small measure to
preserve social order and public decency; and when they were
afterwards superseded, their successors did not appear to greater
advantage.&nbsp; They were not their superiors in abilities, and
they were far inferior to them in number, and probably no less so
in the public estimation, and the weight and extent of their
influence over the minds of the inhabitants at large, especially
those of the middling and lower orders, who constituted the main
body or majority of the inhabitants.&nbsp; For among these there
did not appear to be many then, as there had been formerly, who
were dissatisfied with the old order of things, and anxious for a
religious revolution. <a name="citation672"></a><a
href="#footnote672" class="citation">[672]</a></p>
<p>Before the reformation the number of ecclesiastics or
religious functionaries at Lynn was very considerable, amounting
perhaps to sixty or seventy at least.&nbsp; Of them fifteen
belonged to the <i>Austin</i> Convent, twelve to the
<i>Dominican</i>, ten to the <i>Franciscan</i>, and eleven to the
<i>Carmelite</i>: making in all <i>forty eight</i>.&nbsp; To
these may be added the monks of the <i>Benedictine</i> Priory,
those who belonged to the Convent <i>de Penitentia</i>, and <a
name="page673"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 673</span>to the
<i>College</i> of Priests, amounting, it may be supposed, on a
moderate computation, to twenty or thirty more.&nbsp; Such a
number as seventy or eighty, or even <i>sixty</i> clergymen, or
public teachers of religion, for this town, would now be thought
too large of all reason and conscience.&nbsp; But they were no
fewer here before the reformation, if indeed they were so few;
and the influence of such a number of ghostly guides and
instructors, to restrain immoral excesses, and preserve public
decency and social order, must certainly have been very
considerable.</p>
<p>At the reformation they were all silenced and
suppressed.&nbsp; They were also succeeded, when successors could
be found, (which was not always the case) <a
name="citation673"></a><a href="#footnote673"
class="citation">[673]</a> by men who had renounced the spiritual
supremacy of the pope, and acknowledged that of the king, which
was always an indispensible requirement and qualification.&nbsp;
But very generally, it seems, throughout the nation, the
protestant successors of the priests, monks, and friars, were
poor hands, and ill qualified to instruct <a
name="page674"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 674</span>and
enlighten the people; <a name="citation674"></a><a
href="#footnote674" class="citation">[674]</a> and such, it is
probable, were those who succeeded in this town.&nbsp; There is
reason to think that their number too was very small, not
exceeding perhaps three or four, or half a dozen at most, which,
considering also their deficiency in other respects, was not
likely to render them in the eyes of the public of any thing like
equal consideration with their expelled predecessors.&nbsp; The
state of society therefore could not be expected to be much
benefited or improved, or the progress of the reformation
facilitated and advanced by their ministration.</p>
<p>To supply the wants or defects, and remedy in some measure the
insufficiency of that new race of clergy, the <i>Book of
Homilies</i> was composed and introduced; portions of which were
directed to be read in the churches instead of sermons.&nbsp;
This seems to have been a wise and commendable contrivance, as
things then stood.&nbsp; The generality of the clergy were not
allowed to preach, owing, it is presumed, to their known or
supposed incapacity, or insufficiency to perform that task
properly, or to edification.&nbsp; Those of a superior class, who
were judged equal to that task, were allowed to take out licences
to empower or authorize them to preach to the people.&nbsp; Their
preaching was extempore, or without book, as had always been the
case before, in this <a name="page675"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 675</span>as well as every other
country.&nbsp; They could not therefore be objected to on that
account.</p>
<p>But it so happened that their preaching did not give general
satisfaction; owing, perhaps, partly, if not chiefly, to its
containing what Burnet calls &ldquo;very foul and indiscreet
reflections on the other party;&rdquo; <a
name="citation675a"></a><a href="#footnote675a"
class="citation">[675a]</a> (meaning the papists;) a party which
still contained a large majority of the nation, with not a few of
its first families.&nbsp; However that was, the sermons gave
great offence, and the preachers were much blamed.&nbsp;
Complaints against them were made to the king, &ldquo;by hot men
on both sides,&rdquo; <a name="citation675b"></a><a
href="#footnote675b" class="citation">[675b]</a> as the writer
above mentioned expresses himself.&nbsp; On what ground those of
their own side, the protestants, objected to their preaching, it
is not easy to discover: nor does it appear to be very
material.&nbsp; They must however have been rather unfortunate,
to incur the displeasure of their friends as well as their
enemies.&nbsp; But what makes this of most importance is what
resulted from it, and which we will now proceed to relate.</p>
<p>Of the charges and accusations brought against those preachers
it is very probable that not a few were utterly unfounded and
false, the offspring of envy and malice.&nbsp; Others might be
mere misrepresentations or exaggerations, proceeding from
unintentional mistake or strong prejudice.&nbsp; But as the
discourses referred to and complained of were delivered
extemporaneously or off hand, the accused could not easily and
effectually disprove what their accusers had alleged against
them, as they <a name="page676"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
676</span>could do little more than oppose their own word or
testimony to those allegations, which was not likely to prove
always satisfactory to their superiors.&nbsp; In order therefore
to justify themselves, and be secure in future from
misrepresentation and false accusation, they came generally to
write and read their sermons. <a name="citation676"></a><a
href="#footnote676" class="citation">[676]</a>&nbsp; This was the
beginning of preaching from <i>notes</i>, and thus was the
<i>reading</i> of sermons introduced among the clergy of the
church of England, which has universally prevailed there ever
since, with the exception of the <i>puritans</i> in former times,
and those called <i>evangelical clergy</i> in the present
day.</p>
<p>This practice seems to be still confined to the clergy of the
church of England, and the English presbyterians; which may
account for the small effect the ministry of either has on the
lower orders of the community.&nbsp; By the Scotch Presbyterians,
or the church of Scotland it has never been adopted, nor would it
be deemed, beyond the Tweed, worthy the name of <i>preaching</i>:
all there is extempore, or from memory; yet the common people
there are of far superior morals, and infinitely better informed
than those of this country; which furnishes at least a strong
presumption that the ancient practice is abundantly preferable to
the other in its tendency, aptitude, or adaptation to attract the
attention, impress the minds, improve the manners and character,
and promote the moral and religious proficiency of the lower
ranks of society, which constitute the great body of the
nation.</p>
<p>Such was the practice of the Lollards, or Wickliffites <a
name="page677"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 677</span>formerly,
when they brought half the nation over to their way of thinking;
such also was the practice of the puritans and nonconformists
afterwards, whose success was by no means inconsiderable,
notwithstanding the grievous opposition and persecution which
they had to encounter: and such, we all know, has been and is the
practice of the popular dissenters and methodists of the present
day, who seem to bid fair soon to bring two thirds of the
thinking and serious part of the nation to enlist under their
banners.&nbsp; In short, we know of no preaching, but what has
been extempore or without book, that has ever made very deep
impression, or produced any mighty and salutary effect upon the
minds of the common people.&nbsp; If therefore this kind of
preaching were to cease, or be discontinued among us, there is
every reason to believe that the lower orders of our countrymen
would soon become heathenized, barbarized, and brutalized to a
most deplorable degree; and that the profession of religion would
ere long be confined within narrow limits, and to a comparatively
small party among our middling classes.</p>
<p>This modern device, or, as it may be called, the English mode
of promoting religious knowledge by <i>reading</i> sermons, which
excludes half the nation from almost any chance of receiving
instruction, has yet had its warm admirers and encomiasts among
us, who have not failed most lavishly to congratulate or
compliment their dear country on the important result of this
contrivance, in the unequalled number of English printed sermons,
of a cast and merit superior to those of any other nation.&nbsp;
Now allowing all this to be true, and <a name="page678"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 678</span>that the generality of the clergy
have aimed at excelling in the same way in all their unprinted
discourses, must it not follow that they have taken pains to
compose such elaborate productions as will be, after all, of
little or no use to the greatest part of those who have been
committed to their charge?&nbsp; This seems to be one reason why
so many are seen to withdraw from the church and resort to the
conventicle.&nbsp; May it not be said therefore, that the
practice in question, or this change which commenced at the
reformation, has proved unfavourable, not only to the interest of
the common people of this country, but even to that of the
established church itself?</p>
<p>As to this town, at and for some time after the reformation,
it does not seem likely, from the character of that event, and
the complexion and small number of the reformed successors of the
priests, monks, and friars, that it derived much, if any, moral
or intellectual improvement from that change.&nbsp; Its few
officiating protestant clergymen, with their humdrum reading of
homilies or illsuited sermons, could prove but poor substitutes
for the numerous friars that preceded them, whose preaching, like
that of our modern methodists, &amp;c. was always animated and
energetic, directed chiefly and powerfully to affect the
feelings, and move and rouse the passions of their auditors: and
it was delivered in a plain familiar style, and a language suited
to the weakest understanding and meanest capacity.&nbsp; Here the
friars excelled, and here the preachers of our modern popular
sects excel also, and succeed abundantly, like their prototypes.
<a name="citation678"></a><a href="#footnote678"
class="citation">[678]</a></p>
<p><a name="page679"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 679</span>It
seems very probable, though it may be thought not a little
strange, that the impression and influence of moral and religious
principles have never been so general or extensive among the
common people of this town and country since the reformation, as
they were before, in the time and by means of the friars.&nbsp;
They used to go about unweariedly, and dispense their precepts to
all ranks of people, in a language suited to every capacity, so
that those of the lowest condition appear to have been as much
the objects of their attention, and as completely under their
discipline as any of the rest.&nbsp; This cannot be said to have
been the case at any one period with our established protestant
clergy.&nbsp; One half, if not two thirds of those committed to
their charge have generally lain beyond the range of their
ministry, with little chance of deriving any benefit or advantage
from their labours.&nbsp; They would therefore have remained from
generation to generation in a state of mere barbarism or
heathenism, but for the laudable exertions of some of our
religious sectaries, who yet have been always viewed by our
rulers with an evil eye, when they certainly ought to have been
looked upon with approbation and gratitude, as richly entitled to
their good opinion and encouragement.</p>
<p>We know of no period in the history of this town, from the
reformation to the present time, when a great majority of its
population was not involved in deplorable and heathenish
darkness.&nbsp; Nor do we know of any period when the town was
favoured with a more respectable <a name="page680"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 680</span>clergy than those who officiate in
the churches here at present.&nbsp; Yet the state of the town,
even now, appears to answer to the above description; though
there are here several dissenting chapels, besides the
established places of worship, which are all well attended.&nbsp;
In fact, more than two thirds of our population, at this very
time, notwithstanding all the labours and efforts of our
established and dissenting ministers, appear still to remain as
destitute of any sense of religion as if religion had been
actually abolished, or as if a law had passed to prohibit the
public profession of it.</p>
<p>As to our churches and chapels, though they may be thought by
some too numerous and too spacious, yet they are certainly very
inadequate to the want or accommodation of the inhabitants, in
case they were generally disposed to attend the public
worship.&nbsp; The present writer has lately learnt and
ascertained, that but little more than one third of our
population could be held or accommodated for the purposes of
religious worship in all these places. <a
name="citation680"></a><a href="#footnote680"
class="citation">[680]</a>&nbsp; How very unreasonable therefore
<a name="page681"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 681</span>must
those little jealousies be which our religious parties too often
manifest towards each other, as if religion had been no more than
a trade, and they thought it allowable to vilify their
brother-tradesmen in order to draw more customers to their own
shops.&nbsp; This evil spirit has been more manifest and
predominant here of late years among Dissenters than among
Churchmen.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> VII.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Effects of the reformation at Lynn further
exemplified&mdash;dissolution of the convents</i>,
<i>chapels</i>, <i>and gilds&mdash;suppression and expulsion of
the monks and friars&mdash;the consequences</i>.</p>
<p>It seems very probable, and even morally certain, that all the
inhabitants of this town, before the reformation, were in the
habit of paying attention to religious institutions and
observances, or to the externals of the religion that was then in
vogue.&nbsp; The numerous friars and other religious
functionaries would not fail to keep them to that, as they had,
without doubt, sufficient inclination, influence and power so to
do.&nbsp; From this state of things we may reasonably conclude
that a change for the worse would, and actually did take place
after the reformation, when so many convents and chapels were
shut up, which were before much resorted to: in <a
name="page682"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 682</span>consequence
of which the bulk of the people were necessarily deprived of any
fair chance or opportunity to attend upon, and profit by the
public ministrations of their new or protestant pastors: and
this, as was before observed, has really been the case here to
this day.</p>
<p>The shutting up and demolition of the <i>chapels</i> must have
been a very strange, impolitic, and unaccountable measure; and
the suppression of the <i>gilds</i> was perhaps not much less
so.&nbsp; The former measure deprived more than half the
inhabitants of an opportunity to receive public instruction, or
to attend public worship; and the latter dissolved and abolished
a number of fraternal institutions, or friendly societies, of
long standing, most of which, if not all, seem to have been very
harmless, and many of them apparently of the same useful tendency
as our modern benefit clubs, whose general utility is
unquestionable, and universally acknowledged.&nbsp; Were our
present government to abolish or prohibit these, it would
certainly be, not only an unjustifiable deed, but a real and very
serious grievance.&nbsp; How much less so the suppression of the
Gilds may have been, it is perhaps not very easy to
determine.&nbsp; Though the possessions of some of these Gilds
were very considerable, yet they were all sequestered, and no
part of them, that we know of applied to any public advantage, or
real benefit to the community. <a name="citation682"></a><a
href="#footnote682" class="citation">[682]</a>&nbsp; As it was
with the sequestration of the possessions of the gild companies,
so it was also with that of the possessions of our
<i>convents</i>, or different religious orders.&nbsp; They were
lavishly bestowed <a name="page683"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
683</span>and thrown away on a certain royal minion, or court
favourite, of the name of <i>Eyre</i>, from whom they soon passed
into different hands as regardless as himself of the public
welfare.&nbsp; Had a due regard been paid to the public good,
these possessions might have been laid out, or applied, so as to
form such foundations and establishments as might have proved of
great and lasting benefit to the community, and amply compensate
for any detriment that accrued to the lower ranks of society, or
to the public morals, from the expulsion of the friars, or
shutting up of their houses.&nbsp; But Henry was not the only
sovereign of these realms who appeared more bent upon the
gratification of his own caprice and waywardness than the
promotion or advancement of the public weal.</p>
<p>The <i>poor</i> of this town must have sustained a most
serious loss by the expulsion of the monks and friars and the
sequestration of their revenues; which deprived them of their
best friends, at whose houses they were entertained, not only
with moral and religious instruction, but also with food for
their bodies.&nbsp; For it is well known that the monasteries and
convents were eminent for their hospitality, and furnished the
poor with their chief support in those days.&nbsp; The
<i>friars</i> also were very remarkable for the attention which
they paid the poor and the rest of the common people, over whom
they maintained no small influence, even in seasons of public
commotion, distraction and anarchy.&nbsp; It is no wonder
therefore that those of the lower orders long regretted their
disappearance, and had songs composed <a name="page684"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 684</span>to celebrate the superior felicity
of the times when the country was honoured with their residence.
<a name="citation684a"></a><a href="#footnote684a"
class="citation">[684a]</a></p>
<p>We know of but <i>two</i> periods at which Lynn appears to
have materially suffered from the circumstance of unoccupied or
<i>empty houses</i>.&nbsp; One of those periods is the present,
when the number of such houses amounts to some scores, owing to
the extreme pressure of burdens brought upon the inhabitants by
the inexcusable misdoings of some of their own townsmen. <a
name="citation684b"></a><a href="#footnote684b"
class="citation">[684b]</a>&nbsp; The other <a
name="page685"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 685</span>period was
at the reformation, or after the dissolution of the monasteries,
when all the convents in this town with many chapels and other
religious houses were shut up, and afterwards demolished; so that
the people, for the most part, were left without places where
they might attend public worship and receive religious
instruction; which must have proved very unfavourable to the
public morals, from its obvious and powerful tendency to deprave
and barbarize those who were so situated.</p>
<p>Previously to the actual dissolution of the monasteries,
&amp;c. a formal surrender and resignation, and also a
<i>confession</i>, generally took place.&nbsp; This was solemnly
declared to have been done voluntarily, though the contrary was
well known to have been the fact.&nbsp; These deeds of surrender
are still in being, with some also of the confessions; but most
of them are said to have been destroyed in Mary&rsquo;s reign: it
being then, probably, in contemplation, if circumstances would
admit, to restore those places to their former
occupants.&mdash;The instruments or deeds of surrender from Lynn
are supposed to be still extant in the Augmentation Office.&nbsp;
But as the present writer has not seen them, he can only guess
what their tenor was from such as have fallen in his <a
name="page686"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 686</span>way, which
he has met in Burnet&rsquo;s History of the Reformation, and
Martin&rsquo;s History of Thetford.</p>
<p>The work last mentioned contains a copy of the surrender of
the Dominican Convent at Thetford, addressed &ldquo;To all the
Faithful in Christ,&rdquo; and solemnly declaring that &ldquo;the
Prior and Convent of the House or Priory commonly called The
Black Friars and Convent of the same, with unanimous assent and
consent, with minds deliberate, and with our free will and
certain knowledge, and for certain just and reasonable causes,
our souls and consciences in a special manner moving, freely and
of our own accord have given, granted, and by these presents do
give, grant and restore, release and confirm to the most
illustrious prince, our lord Henry VIII, by the grace of God of
England and France king, defender of the faith, lord of Ireland,
and on earth supreme Head of the English church, all our said
Priory or House called the Black Friars, in Thetford aforesaid,
together with all and singular the messuages, gardens, tofts,
lands, tenements, meadows, feeds, pastures, woods, rents,
reversions, services, mills, &amp;c. &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Surrender was dated 30. Henry VIII, and subscribed by the
<i>Prior Richard Cley</i>, <i>Robert Baldry</i>, <i>Edward
Dyer</i>, <i>Edmund Palmer</i>, and two more.&mdash;&ldquo;Those
mercenary monks (says Martin) were obliged by royal authority to
resign what they valued most upon earth, and declare the will of
their sovereign to be the motion of their own minds; whereas
their possessions were extorted from them contrary to their
wishes <a name="page687"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
687</span>and inclinations.&nbsp; They acquired their wealth by
hypocrisy, and parted with it under the influence of the same
principle.&rdquo; <a name="citation687"></a><a
href="#footnote687" class="citation">[687]</a>&nbsp; But he
should have remembered that hypocrisy of much the same sort was
displayed by the corporations, or the different cities and
boroughs, in the reign of James II, in the surrender of their
respective charters: and the hypocrisy of the latter was perhaps
much less excusable than that of the poor friars, because they
were in much less peril.&mdash;The mayors and aldermen ran no
risk of hanging, but several of the others were actually hanged,
for refusing to surrender and play the hypocrites.</p>
<p>A copy of the Surrender of the <i>Carmelites</i> in Stamford
has been preserved by Burnet, and is as follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Forasmuch as we the Prior and Friers of
this House of <i>Carmelites</i> in <i>Stamford</i>, commonly
called the White Friers in Stamford, in the County of
<i>Lincoln</i>, do profoundly consider that the perfection of
Christian living doth not consist in some Ceremonies, wearing of
a white Coat, disguising ourselves after strange fashions,
dockying and becking, wearing Scapulars and Hoods, and other-like
Papistical Ceremonies, wherein we have been most principally
practised and noseled in times past; but the very true way to
please God, and to live a true Christian Man, without all
hyprocrisy and feigned dissimulation, is sincerely declared to us
by our Master Christ, his Evangelists and Apostles; being minded
hereafter to follow the same, conforming ourselves to the will
and pleasure of our supreme Head, <a name="page688"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 688</span>under God, on Earth, the
King&rsquo;s Majesty; and not to follow henceforth the
superstitious traditions of any forinsecal potentate or power,
with mutual assent and consent, do submit ourselves unto the
mercy of our said Sovereign Lord, and with the Like mutual assent
and consent do surrender,&rdquo; &amp;c. <a
name="citation688"></a><a href="#footnote688"
class="citation">[688]</a>&mdash;signed by the Prior and six
Friers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poor monks and friars and nuns, previously to their
expulsion, were forced to play the hypocrites and tell lies to
save their necks, which was certainly very hard upon them.&nbsp;
But rulers have seldom minded or <a name="page689"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 689</span>commiserated hardships of that
sort.&nbsp; With whatever they ordain or impose they always
expect a ready compliance, however unreasonable in itself, or
however hard it may bear on the consciences of their
subjects.&nbsp; The above religious orders, by falsely declaring
that they surrendered voluntarily and of their own accord, saved
their lives, but lost their livelihood.&nbsp; A few abbots
&amp;c. were provided for; but thousands of friars and nuns were
turned out into the wide world pennyless; which must have been
very inhuman and cruel.&nbsp; We are assured that the arts
flourished in the convents to the last.&nbsp; Many of the abbots
and other heads of houses had been terrified, persuaded, or
bribed, as it is said, to surrender their trusts.&nbsp; Three
only (those of Colchester, Reading and Glastonbury) resisted to
the last, and fell by the hands of the executioner. <a
name="citation689"></a><a href="#footnote689"
class="citation">[689]</a></p>
<p>With respect to Lynn, it does not appear that the heads of the
houses or convents, or any of the brethren, made the least
difficulty to surrender in the form and manner prescribed to
them.&nbsp; They therefore ran no risk of the gallows: they saved
their lives, but lost their living; for they were turned adrift
and thrown upon <a name="page690"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
690</span>the wide world.&nbsp; Many of them, and of their fellow
sufferers, had a pretty good chance of obtaining subsistence by
their own ingenuity; for they had among them some excellent
penmen, some notable carvers, some admirable embroiderers, some
intelligent gardeners; and, in short, some that excelled in every
useful art, and in all handycraft employments.&nbsp; There they
had greatly the advantage of our modern clergy, many of whom, it
is to be feared, know little beyond what appertains to the
occupation of sportsmen or foxhunters, which would afford but a
poor prospect of subsistence, if they had nothing else to depend
upon.</p>
<p>Moreover, we must reckon among the most striking and memorable
effects which the reformation had upon Lynn the very visible and
degrading change it produced in the aspect or appearance of the
town, reducing it, as it evidently did, to a most mean and paltry
object, compared to what it was previously to that event.&nbsp;
For the demolition and disappearance of so many stately edifices,
which had long been the pride and boast of the inhabitants, must
have had a most strange, humiliating and transforming effect upon
the place, both with respect to its external aspect, or as it
appeared without from the adjacent country, and also as it looked
within, to those who passed through its streets, or observed it
internally.&nbsp; It must have looked somewhat like a town that
had undergone a close and successful siege, and which had been
left half demolished and ruined by a victorious and exasperated
enemy.&nbsp; In short, the present Lynn, or this town since the
reformation, <a name="page691"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
691</span>must have always made a far inferior, or much meaner
figure than the former or papal Lynn, with its four large and
stately convents, adorned with lofty towers, and ranged along the
whole town from south to north.&nbsp; Besides them we must also
reckon the Benedictine Priory, the convent of the friars <i>de
Penitentia</i>, the College, the churches or chapels of St. John,
St. James, St. Catherine, St. Anne, those of our Lady at the
Bridge and on the Mount, and undoubtedly other venerable
structures, whose sites and very names are now forgotten and
unknown.</p>
<p>In fine, there were perhaps not many towns in the kingdom, if
indeed there were any at all, whose appearance underwent a
greater change than this, at, and in consequence of the
reformation.&nbsp; Had two persons, a papist and a protestant,
who remembered the town in its former state, now visited and
jointly surveyed it, one would have been apt to take up his
lamentation and pronounce <i>Ichabod</i>! its glory is departed!
while the other would be no less apt exultingly to exclaim
&ldquo;Babylon is fallen, is fallen!&rdquo;&mdash;But a
<i>third</i> person, accustomed to view things with the eyes of a
christian philosopher, would have given way to neither
lamentation nor exultation, but would have considered the whole
as the natural effect of a mighty revolution, and an additional
proof of the changing and perishing nature of all human
productions and sublunary magnificence.</p>

692</span>CHAP. II.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">History of Lynn for the first hundred years
after the reformation; or rather, from the dissolution of the
monasteries to the meeting of the long parliament and
commencement of the civil wars.</p>
<p>In the preceding account of the immediate effects of the
reformation upon this town little or nothing occurs that appears
of a very pleasing or favourable nature.&nbsp; No symptoms are
discernable of either moral or intellectual improvement.&nbsp;
The town had become protestant, but superstition and ignorance
still remained, and licentiousness and barbarism seemed rather to
increase than diminish.&nbsp; The former religious functionaries
or instructors were expelled, and they were succeeded by men less
competent than themselves for the tuition or instruction of the
people: and therefore it was not to be expected that the latter
should be better taught, or further enlightened under their
guidance and management.&nbsp; On the contrary, we may suppose
them to have gone in a retrograde rather than in a progressive
direction: and so it seems really to have happened.&nbsp; In <a
name="page693"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 693</span>fact, very
little appears to have been done here of reformation work, or for
the advancement of protestantism during the long period now under
consideration, besides the expulsion of the monks and friars and
demolition of their Houses.&nbsp; Of that little, some account
shall be given in the following section.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> I.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Statement of the progress of
protestantism</i>, <i>or of the most remarkable and memorable
acts or works of reformation which took place at Lynn during the
first century after its renunciation of the papal
supremacy</i>.</p>
<p>The first fruits of the reformation at Lynn seem to be the
burning of the Dutchman before mentioned, and hanging, sometime
after, a certain friar, of the name of <i>William
Gisborough</i>.&nbsp; The former suffered for what was called
<i>heresy</i>, but we cannot find what the crime was that was
laid to the charge of the latter.&nbsp; It seems most probable
however, that it was denying the king&rsquo;s spiritual
supremacy, or maintaining that the pope, and not his majesty, was
the supreme head of the church.&nbsp; This was a crime, or
heresy, which Henry never would tolerate, after he had set up for
himself in competition with the Roman pontiff, as a kind of
antipope, or pontifex maximus of England.&nbsp; Many a luckless
wight was put to death, during the latter part of his reign, for
no other fault, or offence, but that of being <a
name="page694"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 694</span>unconvinced
of his majesty&rsquo;s right and title to be on earth the supreme
head of the English church.&nbsp; They could not, it seems, help
their scruples; and therefore it was, surely, very hard and cruel
to put them to death.&nbsp; But kings and courtiers are seldom
disposed to be very tender, or shew much mercy to those who do
not think well of their pretensions, however doubtful,
unreasonable, or absurd they happen to be: and they come not
unfrequently under one or other of these denominations.</p>
<p>In <i>Edward&rsquo;s</i> reign, very little if any reformation
work appears to have been carried on at Lynn.&nbsp; At his death
we are told that Lord Audley came here and proclaimed Lady Jane
Grey queen of England; which seems to imply that this town was
favourable to her succession.&nbsp; However that was, her
succession was frustrated, and she came soon after to an untimely
and tragical end, though she appears to have been worthy of a
better fate.&mdash;<i>Mary</i> succeeded; in whose reign the very
name of reformation was exploded: its favourers were persecuted
with the utmost rigour, hundreds of them suffered at the stake,
and a still greater number fled their native country, and found
an asylum in foreign parts, where they staid till the storm was
blown over, or, in other words, till Mary was no more.&nbsp; She
was succeeded by a sovereign that was more favourable to a
certain description of reformation and reformers, though in other
respects of an equally intolerant and unamiable character.</p>
<p>At the accession of <i>Elizabeth</i> the pope was again
discarded, and her majesty assumed the character of reformer and
supreme head of the church.&nbsp; The protestant <a
name="page695"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 695</span>exiles now
returned home, and resumed the arduous task of reforming their
countrymen, though from what is known to have been the conduct of
too many of them while abroad, it would seem that they ought
first of all to have <i>reformed themselves</i>.&nbsp; They
rapidly obtained preferment in the church, and many of them were
promoted to the vacant sees, some of whom soon became most bitter
persecutors of the poor puritans and other protestant
sectaries:&mdash;so little good effect had their former
sufferings upon them, and so far was their experience of the
bitterness of persecution from disposing them to refrain from
being themselves concerned in the same bloody and detestable
work.</p>
<p>The effect of the new order of things was soon felt at Lynn,
and the inhabitants were furnished with convincing proofs that
the new was once more to supersede and triumph over the old
religion.&nbsp; In the first year of this queen&rsquo;s reign,
&ldquo;the rood lofts,&rdquo; we are told, &ldquo;and the images
that were upon them, were taken down from all the churches in
this town.&rdquo;&nbsp; There surely could be no great harm in
this.&nbsp; The harm, if there was any, must lie in its being
done before the people had been convinced of the inutility and
impropriety of setting up such images and retaining them in their
churches.&nbsp; The work certainly should have succeeded and not
preceded the people&rsquo;s conviction of its reasonableness and
propriety.</p>
<p>At the same time, or in the course of the same year 1559
&ldquo;The steps,&rdquo; as we further learn, &ldquo;were taken
from <a name="page696"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 696</span>the
altars in this town, and the ground, at the upper, or east ends
of all the churches levelled with that in the other parts of
them.&rdquo;&mdash;All this seems to have been a courtly or royal
mode of reforming: for it appears to have been done before the
inhabitants were convinced of its necessity, or knew any thing
about the meaning of it.&nbsp; It was done, no doubt, by royal
authority; and that is reason enough for any thing, in the eyes
of most courtiers and statesmen.&nbsp; It was, however, a
preposterous mode of proceeding, as it was beginning the work at
the wrong end, and treating the people as if they had not been
rational beings, but were to be brought under discipline and made
to obey their masters or managers just like all other
cattle.&nbsp; But mankind have been treated pretty much in the
same way in all ages.</p>
<p>The year following, (1560,) &ldquo;several gentlemen came
here,&rdquo; (as it is said,) &ldquo;by order of the privy
council, to take the state of St. James&rsquo;s church, but were
opposed and resisted by the corporation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whether the
object of those gentlemen, in taking the state of the said church
was to have it repaired and refitted for a place of worship, or
something else, we are not told.&nbsp; If the former the
corporation was probably to blame in resisting them, as there
seemed to be need enough for an additional place of worship, if
it was thought desirable that the inhabitants should more
generally attend at such places.&nbsp; Nor is it very easy to
conceive how the corporation durst resist them, if they were
indeed authorised by Letters from the privy council to do what
they proposed.&nbsp; In short, the circumstance is involved in
too much obscurity <a name="page697"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
697</span>and uncertainly to allow our hazarding any decided
opinion upon it.</p>
<p>The next year, (1561,) &ldquo;many popish relics and mass
books are said to have been burnt here, in the market
place.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, probably, was also premature; being
done, in all likelihood, before the inhabitants were sufficiently
enlightened and satisfied of the inutility or perniciousness of
those books and relicks.&nbsp; The articles thus destroyed were
seemingly such as had belonged to this town, and had been, till
then, carefully preserved here.&nbsp; It is not very clear that
the destruction of them could be of any material advantage to the
cause of the reformation: it only serves to shew the spirit and
complexion of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reforming system.&mdash;About
seven years after the date of this last transaction, another very
similar to it occurred here: for we are told under 1568,
&ldquo;This year several vestments, popish relics, strings of
beads, and crucifixes, were brought from Tilney to Lynn, and
burnt in the open market.&rdquo;&nbsp; This seems to indicate
that Tilney was a very noted place for that kind of ware before
the reformation: but it was now, as we may suppose, entirely
deprived of them, so as to be reduced, in that respect, upon a
level with the rest of its neighbours.&nbsp; This, however, would
not have signified much, had the people been carefully instructed
and rationalized.&nbsp; But that really appears have been
exceedingly and shamefully neglected at Lynn and the parts
adjacent for a very long period after the accession of Elizabeth,
as we shall endeavour to shew in the following Section.</p>
<h4><a name="page698"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Observations on the slow progress</i>,
<i>or low state of protestantism</i>, <i>and of intellectual and
moral improvement at Lynn during the period under
consideration</i>.</p>
<p>During no one part of the long century which we are now
reviewing does it appear that this town had any great taste or
desire for reformation.&nbsp; It was forced upon it at first,
rather than sought for or desired; and it was submitted to out of
pure loyalty, or profound deference to his majesty&rsquo;s royal
will and better judgment, as would, probably, have been the case
had he appointed Mahomet, instead of the pope, or himself, to be
the Head of the church.&nbsp; Be that as it might, it seems
pretty evident that Lynn remained in a very dark and unimproved
state from the era of the reformation till towards the middle of
the seventeenth century, if not much longer.&nbsp; It bore indeed
the name of a protestant town, but its faith, its morals, and its
manners, appear not to have been at all superior, or more
estimable than they were when it was a popish town, or remained
under the papal jurisdiction.&nbsp; Thus it has often happened,
that large communities as well as individuals have borne the
honourable names of christians and protestants while they
remained as far from the kingdom of heaven, or from the light and
influence and spirit of the New Testament as the most
superstitious romanists, or blindest heathens.</p>
<p>In the early part and near the commencement of this period,
<i>Baret</i>, a native of this town, as was before mentioned,
renouncing popery, embraced protestantism, and <a
name="page699"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 699</span>became a
very laborious and famous preacher.&nbsp; But it was Norwich, and
not Lynn that reaped the benefit of his labours; a pretty plain
indication of the very low estimation in which eminent protestant
preachers were then held among our ancestors.&nbsp; Had they
highly appreciated the labours of such instructors, there can be
little doubt but they would have invited and encouraged him to
settle here: nor is it less probable that he would in that case
have preferred his native town to any other place.&nbsp; But as
there is not the least appearance of its being thought of getting
him to settle here, it is very natural to conclude that Lynn was
then no way zealous in the cause of reformation, and felt no kind
of anxiety for introducing and establishing an able protestant
ministry: and the same we presume continued to be the case for a
very long season afterwards.</p>
<p>About the latter part of the reign of James I, or the
beginning of that of his successor, the pious, learned, and
memorable <i>Samuel Fairclough</i> became lecturer of this town:
and he is the only protestant preacher that we know of among the
Lynn clergy, during this long period, who set himself in good
earnest, and with any prospect of success, about civilizing the
town or reforming the inhabitants.&nbsp; But a host of enemies
rose against him, which soon obliged him to desist and
retire.&nbsp; The whole body of <i>publicans</i> and
<i>sinners</i>, (and among the latter, without doubt, the
manufacturers of strong beer, or the <i>brewers</i>, <a
name="citation699"></a><a href="#footnote699"
class="citation">[699]</a>) became decidedly hostile <a
name="page700"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 700</span>to him; for
it was found that great numbers of those who formerly used to
spend their Sundays at the alehouses, now discontinued that
practice, and attended Fairclough&rsquo;s ministry.&nbsp; This
was very alarming to the votaries of the great goddess Diana, of
Lynn.&nbsp; Like the Ephesian craftsmen, they perceived that
their beloved craft, by which they got their wealth, was in
imminent danger, and therefore it was high time to bestir
themselves, and make such an outcry and uproar against this
troublesome preacher as would oblige him to desist and
decamp.</p>
<p>What greatly promoted and insured the attainment of their
wishes was, that the diocesan, <i>Dr. Harsnett</i>, with his
spiritual (or rather diabolical) court took the same side.&nbsp;
The other clergy of the town were also supposed, out of envy, to
do the same, underhand.&nbsp; The pretext for this spiritual
interference was, that the preacher did not use the sign of the
cross in the ceremony of christening; which, however disorderly
some might deem it, had certainly nothing in it of moral
turpitude.&nbsp; Had the whole ceremony been omitted, as well as
that idle appendage, there would have been, perhaps, no mighty
loss to any body, except to the preacher himself, who, in that
case, it may be supposed, would have sustained some loss.&nbsp;
In short, this preacher of righteousness was driven away by the
violence and threatening aspect of the opposition that had been
raised against him, and which to him and friends appeared
irresistible.&nbsp; He removed to <i>Clare</i> in Suffolk, a more
christianlike place, where, and in the adjacent parts, he long
continued <a name="page701"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
701</span>eminently useful, as well as greatly and deservedly
respected.&nbsp; The Lynn people by expelling him prolonged the
duration of their own blindness and barbarism.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> III.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The fast of </i><span
class="smcap"><i>Lent</i></span><i> rigidly enforced and strictly
observed at Lynn to the very close of this period</i>, <i>a
further proof of the dark and unreformed state of the
town&mdash;additional observations</i>.</p>
<p>That the observance of <i>Lent</i> was rigorously enforced and
religiously regarded here as late as the reign of Charles I,
admits of no manner of doubt.&nbsp; None, but those whose cases
absolutely required it, were allowed here to taste of flesh meat
during all that season.&nbsp; In such cases <i>licences</i> were
applied for to the parish-minister, and obtained, provided the
cases came well attested.&nbsp; But a strict charge was given not
to exceed the bounds, or time, specified in the licence, without
acquainting the minister, in order to have the licence renewed
and continued.&nbsp; Of this we have sufficient evidence in the
old parish-book of South Lynn, where, under the date of 1632,
there is the following memorandum, in the hand writing of Mr.
<i>Man</i>, who was then the minister of that parish.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A Copy of a License for eating flesh in
time of childbed, to the wife of goodman Sowell of South Lynn,
blacksmyth, according to law, during the time of her <a
name="page702"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 702</span>sickness,
granted the 14. of March 1633, and now eight dayes after, her
sicknes still continuing, registered hereunder as
followeth&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forasmuch as the wife of goodman Sowell of South Lynn
(being a member of the Borough of King&rsquo;s Lynn) in the
county of Norfolk, blacksmith, now lying in childbed, is by the
testimony of the midwife and her said husband and others,
testified to me to be very weak and sick; these are therefore,
upon her and friends very earnest request, so far as in me is,
and according to the statute in that behalf provided, for the
better recovery of her former health and strength again, to
signify that by me the minister of the said parish, she is
licensed, the time of Lent notwithstanding, to eat flesh: Always
provided that the said license continue no longer in force than
only for the time of this her present sicknes: And if this her
present sicknes shall continue above the space of eight days next
after the date hereof, that then I be certified thereof further
to perform and do therein as law requireth.&nbsp; In witness
whereof the day and year above written I have hereunto sett my
hand and seale</p>

class="citation">[702b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page703"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 703</span>The
duty of the Lynn Clergy must have been much greater then,
especially during the time of Lent, than it is at present; for it
may be supposed that these applications for licences were not few
or unfrequent: and if they were obliged to do this work for
nothing, it must have been still harder upon them.&nbsp; However
that was, this practice seems to have continued till the civil
wars broke out, or till the town was besieged and taken by the
Earl of Manchester, when it was strongly garrisoned by the
parliament, and made to undergo a civil as well as religious
reformation.&nbsp; This appears to have been the greatest and
most thorough reformation this town ever underwent, or
experienced; at least, since the days of Henry VIII: for the long
parliament, like his majesty, seldom did things by halves, but
generally carried on with energy and effect whatever they took
earnestly in hand.</p>
<p>It may very safely be concluded that the religious observance
of Lent was discontinued at Lynn from the time referred to till
the <i>restoration</i>, when it seems to have been again revived,
both here and throughout the kingdom, among all true
churchmen.&nbsp; For it appears to have been one of those choice
and invaluable blessings which Charles II, (that <i>most
sacred</i>, and <i>most religious</i> sovereign, as his bishops
and clergy used to call him,) restored to us at his return from
exile.&nbsp; Accordingly, we find, by the public prints and
records of that period, that his majesty from the beginning of
his reign, or first arrival, was attentive to this point.&nbsp;
Among <a name="page704"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
704</span>other plain indications of this is a striking passage
in the <i>Mercurius Publicus</i>, of February 21, 1661, (a
flaming weekly court paper of that time,) which is worded as
follows.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;London Feb. 16.&mdash;We are commanded to
give Notice of a malicious Slander against the good government of
the city of London for observation of Lent according to law and
his <span class="smcap">Majesties</span> <i>Proclamation</i>:
some malecontents suggesting that the company of
<i>Fishmongers</i> have confessed they are not able to supply the
market with fish sufficient for this occasion; (and therefore
that the late proclamation will be recalled) which is so false
and bottomles a fiction that the most vigilant Lord Maior hath
assured the Lords of his <span class="smcap">Majesties</span>
Privy Council how the company of fishmongers do not only
undertake to furnish the market with plenty and variety of good
and wholesome fish, but to sell fish cheaper by twopence in a
shilling; which is more than sufficient to stop the mouths of all
that are averse to our good and wholesome laws (made upon so long
experience, and so necessary for the common good and safety of
this Island) which yet deprive none of the benefit of
dispensation, whose condition really requires other dyet, such as
are aged, or infants, women with child, sick persons, and such
whose health and constitution is known to be prejudiced by
continuall eating fish; for all whom the Law hath provided
Licences and Dispensations to eat Flesh.&rdquo; <a
name="citation704"></a><a href="#footnote704"
class="citation">[704]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page705"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 705</span>Here
Charles appears in the character of a <i>religious king</i>, to
which he, of all men living, had, perhaps, the least
pretension.&nbsp; Yet his bishops and clergy unblushingly gave
him that title, and would frequently mention him, even in their
addresses to the Deity himself, under the same appellation, and
under one still stronger&mdash;&ldquo;Our <i>most</i> religious
king!&rdquo;&nbsp; So much for the bishops and clergy of those
days.&nbsp; But it was in <i>Scotland</i> that his
majesty&rsquo;s <i>religious</i> and <i>reforming</i> character,
at least in respect to the strict observance of Lent, was
exhibited in the most striking light.&nbsp; This may be inferred
from the following curious document in the above mentioned
Court-newspaper of Feb. 26. 1662, which, though somewhat
extraneous and out of place, the author hopes the reader will
excuse his introducing it here, as he knew of no fitter place for
its insertion.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Edinburgh</i> 12. Febr.
1662.&mdash;Forasmuch as the not keeping of Lent and Fish days,
conform to several Acts of Parliament and late Act of Council of
the sixth of <i>February</i> 1662, hath been occasioned by not
exacting the penalties therein contained from the contraveeners,
who, upon hopes of impunity, may still continue disobey the saids
Acts, to the great prejudice of the kingdom: Therefore the Lords
of his Majesties Privy <a name="page706"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 706</span>Council have thought fit to cause
intimat publickly at the Mercat Cross of <i>Edinburgh</i>, that
none presume nor take upon hand to contraveen the saids Acts;
with certification if they failize, the pains and penalties
therein contained shall be exacted with all rigour: and that they
will crave an account of all Magistrates and other Ministers of
Justice, who are intrusted to procure obedience to the saids
Acts, and give notice of the offendors within their respective
bounds, as they will be answerable; and for that effect to cause,
of new again, intimat the aforesaid Act; whereof the tenor
follows&mdash;The Lords of His Majesties Privy Councill taking to
their consideration the greatest advantage and profit will
redound to all the Leiges of this kingdome, by keeping the time
of Lent and the weekly Fish dayes, <i>viz. Wednesday</i>,
<i>Friday</i>, and <i>Saturday</i>, and discharging of all
persons to eat any flesh, during that time and upon the saids
dayes; or to kill or sell in the Marcats any sort of Fleshes
which are usually brought at other times, whereby the young brood
and store will be preserved; so that hereafter the hazard of
scarcity and dearth may be prevented, and the fishes, which by
the mercy of God, abound in the salt and fresh waters of this
kingdome, may be made use of for the food and entertainment of
the Lieges, to the profit and encouragment of many poor families
who live by fishing; the improvement whereof hath not been looked
to these many years by gone, which hath been occasioned by the
universal allowance of eating flesh and keeping of Mercats at all
ordinary times without any restraint, against which many laudable
Laws and Acts of Parliament have been made, prohibiting <a
name="page707"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 707</span>the eating
flesh during the said time of Lent or upon the saids Fishdays,
under the pains therein contained.&nbsp; Therefore, Ordains and
Commands, that the time of Lent, for this year, and yearly
hereafter, shall begin and be kept as before the year of God
1640, and that the saids weekly Fishdays be strictly observed in
all time coming.&nbsp; And that no subject of whatsoever rank,
quality or degree (except they have a special Licence) presume to
eat any flesh during the said time of Lent, or upon the saids
three weekly Fishdayes; and that no Butchers, Cooks, or Hostlers,
kill, make ready or sell any flesh, either publickly in Mercats
or privately in their own houses, during the said time or upon
the saids dayes, under the penalties following, to be exacted
with all rigour, <i>viz.</i> For the first fault 10<i>l</i>; for
the second 20<i>l</i>; and for the third fault 40<i>l</i>; and so
to be multiplied according to the oft contraveening of the said
Act, to be exacted and payed, the one half to the king&rsquo;s
Majesty, and the other half to the delators.&nbsp; Likeas, for
the surer exacting of the said pains, they give power and warrand
to all Magistrates within Burghs, and all Sheriffs, Stewards, and
Bailies within their several Jurisdictions, to enquire after the
contraveeners and to pursue them before the Lords of Privy
Council, or such others as shall be appointed or delegat for that
effect.&nbsp; And ordains Heraulds, Macers, or Messengers at

</blockquote>
<p><a name="page708"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 708</span>The
above may serve as a sample of the manner in which that father of
his people, king Charles II, managed, disciplined, and educated
his Caledonian children.&nbsp; It was severe enough; but he
sometimes far exceeded this specimen of his paternal attention;
especially when he had some of the most obstreperous of those
children of his <i>hunted with bloodhounds</i>, like wild
beasts.&nbsp; This, as we learn from Laing&rsquo;s excellent
History of Scotland, was sometimes actually the case in that
memorable reign.&nbsp; Having been naturally led to these
digressions by the circumstance of the strict and religious
observance of Lent in this town till near the middle of the 17th
century, (which shews the small progress protestantism had made
here down to that period,) we shall now resume the thread of our
history.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> IV.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Observations on other occurrences relating
to Lynn during the period under consideration</i>.</p>
<p>Lynn appears to have been several times visited, during this
period, by the plague and other destructive diseases; and there
is great reason to be thankful that it has not in more modern
times experienced the like awful visitations.&nbsp; In 1540 the
town is said to have been so severely afflicted with hot burning
agues, (or intermittent fevers) and fluxes, that no Mart was kept
here that year; which shews that the disorder must have <a
name="page709"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 709</span>raged to a
terrible degree, and proved a most severe scourge to the
town.&nbsp; The <i>plague</i> also was here three or four
different times within this period.&nbsp; The last of them was in
1636, when it raged so violently and dreadfully that the markets
were discontinued, and wooden houses or sheds were set up under
the town-walk for the reception of the diseased, especially those
of the poorer sort.&nbsp; It must have been a most awful season,
and the present generation ought to rejoice in having escaped
such calamities.&mdash;In 1598 also there was here a very great
and destructive sickness: but it is not said of what sort or
description it was: only we are told, that the mortality was so
great, from <i>March</i> to <i>July</i>, that three hundred and
twenty persons were buried in St. James&rsquo;s Church
Yard.&nbsp; To whatever cause it is to be ascribed, it seems to
be a fact, that this town has been much healthier for the last
140 years than it was during the period of which we are now
treating.&nbsp; There is a natural cause, no doubt, for that
difference, though it may not be a very easy matter, perhaps, to
discover it, or point it out.</p>
<p>It may be here further observed, that it was within this
period the parish of All-Hallows, or All Saints, otherwise
<i>South Lynn</i>, became a part or member of this Borough; being
before a separate parish or hamlet, subject to the jurisdiction
of the sheriff of the county.&nbsp; This union, or incorporation
was first effected in 1546, by a <i>Licence</i> from the king,
and afterwards fully confirmed by the <i>Charter</i> of Philip
and Mary, in the fourth year of their reign.&nbsp; From that
period it has ever been <a name="page710"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 710</span>under the jurisdiction of the mayor,
as an integral or indivisible part of the borough.&nbsp; Yet it
has been long after, (if not down quite to our time,) treated by
the corporation somewhat like a step-daughter, or as regular
governments (as they are called,) are too apt to treat ceded or
conquered places.&nbsp; Of this some remarkable instances have
occurred at different times, and especially in the reign of
Charles II, when the South Lynnians were very wrongfully involved
in a most vexatious <i>law-suit</i> with the mayor and
corporation, about the <i>Long Bridge</i>, which ended
unfavourably to the latter, as has been also the case with our
corporation law-suits, not unfrequently since that period.&nbsp;
The above cause was tried at Thetford in 1672 before Sir Matthew
Hale, who was exceedingly severe on the conduct of the mayor and
corporation in that affair.</p>
<p>Many events are mentioned as having occurred at Lynn, during
this period, of whose circumstances we are left very much in the
dark: among them are the following&mdash;in 1562, <i>Sir Nicholas
Le Strange</i> (according to one old MS.) &ldquo;began a suit
against Lynn for the House of Corpus Christi:&rdquo; but we are
not told either where that house stood, or what was the ground of
that knight&rsquo;s claim to it, or yet how the suit
terminated.&mdash;In 1567 St. Margaret&rsquo;s spire is said to
have been shot down by a Dutch ship that then lay in the harbour,
as were also several little crosses and ornaments on different
parts of the church.&rdquo;&nbsp; But we cannot learn how all
this happened; whether designedly, or otherwise, or what was its
result.&nbsp; In 1575 <i>Henry Wodehouse</i>, vice admiral <a
name="page711"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 711</span>of Norfolk
is said to have arrested two Fly-Boats at Lynn, by process, which
he delivered to the mayor, who refusing to serve them, brought
great trouble on himself and several others.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
also is related so baldly, that it is impossible to form any
adequate idea of the affair.&nbsp; Of much the same sort is what
we read under 1587, &ldquo;Sir <i>Robert Southwell</i>, being
admiral of Norfolk, with several commissioners and justices, sat
at Lynn and held a court of admiralty, at which sixteen
<i>pirates</i> were condemned, and most of them executed at
<i>Gannock</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is in vain we enquire into the
particular case or circumstantial history of those pirates: all
we can learn is that there were so many then tried and condemned
here, and that <i>Gannock</i> was in the mean time the place of
execution.</p>
<p>The following Lynn occurrences of this period are somewhat
more luminous than the preceding ones.&nbsp; In 1576 queen
Elizabeth visited Norwich; but it does not appear that her
majesty deigned to honour Lynn with her royal presence.&nbsp; The
corporation, however, went to meet her majesty.&nbsp; It is not
said where, but we may suppose it to have been at Norwich, where
her highness appears to have made some stay.&nbsp; At that
interview, wherever it took place, our corporation presented
their gracious sovereign with &ldquo;a <i>rich purse</i>, finely
wrought with pearl and gold, containing <i>an hundred old angels
of gold</i>;&rdquo; the whole valued at 200<i>l.</i> a sum equal,
perhaps, to 2 or 3,000<i>l.</i> of our money.&nbsp; This, no
doubt, was very handsome, and a proof of the sterling loyalty, <a
name="page712"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 712</span>as well as
of the wealth and liberality of our corporation.&nbsp; What our
virgin queen thought of this specimen of Lynn loyalty and homage,
we are not told: but if the same had been done to her renowned
grandfather, Henry VII, when he visited this town, we may be very
sure that it would have proved highly acceptable and gratifying,
as he is well known to have been a most ardent lover of
money.&nbsp; His grand-daughter was in some things very different
from him.&nbsp; Nor are we quite certain, though the gift was
very handsome, that her majesty did not on this occasion laugh in
her sleeve at the vanity and ostentation of the donors, who
appear to have given her too much reason for so doing.&nbsp; She
is also understood as not entertaining, in general, a very
exalted opinion of the sagacity of her corporations, or the
wisdom of the ruling and leading men of her cities and boroughs,
who in her different excursions would sometimes sadly expose
their folly, and excite in no small degree her contempt and
derision. <a name="citation712"></a><a href="#footnote712"
class="citation">[712]</a></p>
<p><a name="page713"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 713</span>In,
or about 1582, it is said, &ldquo;that certain lusty young
fellows began to set up ringing again, which for sometime had
been disused; divers of the aldermen, meaning to silence them,
occasioned a great disturbance, which turned to the mayor&rsquo;s
disadvantage, and was the cause of spending a great deal of
money.&rdquo;&nbsp; For aught we know, the mayor and aldermen
might be very right on this occasion.&nbsp; Where there is a
great deal of ringing it is certainly a very serious nuisance to
the inhabitants, especially those who live near the
steeples.&mdash;It is probable that those <i>lusty young
fellows</i> belonged to some wealthy families, which enabled them
to make so effectual a stand against the mayor and
aldermen.&nbsp; Be that as it might, this circumstance may serve
to shew what serious results may proceed from very frivolous
causes, and how easily a parcel of idle fellows may sometimes
disturb the tranquillity of a whole town, and bring every thing
into the utmost confusion.</p>
<p>In 1587 the <i>wife of one John Wanker</i> and the <i>widow
Porker</i> were both <i>carted</i> here for <i>whoredom</i>: and
we <a name="page714"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
714</span>further learn, that the sin of whoredom was deemed so
detestable then, both at Lynn, and Norwich, that whoever were
guilty of it were publickly exposed fastened to a cart and driven
through the whole town.&mdash;This must be highly honourable to
the moral character of both places at that period, and furnishes
a favourable idea of the state of society here in the mean
time.&nbsp; But alas! how very different must have been the
character of Lynn then, from what it is at present, when it is
said to abound with that sort of sinners more than any other
place of its size, and when that vice seems no longer detested,
or thought to have any moral pravity or turpitude attached to it:
and as to the interference of magistrates, that seems to be
entirely out of the question.&nbsp; After all, it seems to be a
fact, that the unexampled burdens under which the people now lie,
have contributed in no small degree to bring things to this sad
pass.</p>
<p>The year 1558 was rendered remarkable in the annals of this
town, by an <i>order</i>, as it is called, which was then made,
&ldquo;that on every first <i>Monday</i> in the Month there
should be a meeting at a certain house, consisting of the Mayor,
some of the aldermen and common Council-men, and the preachers,
in order to settle peace and quietness between man and man, and
to decide all manner of controversies: and it was called, <i>The
Feast of Reconciliation</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;This certainly looks
well, and seems to reflect honour on the memory of the projector
or projectors of it, as well as those who afterwards devoted
their time for so useful and laudable a purpose.&nbsp; It is <a
name="page715"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 715</span>certainly
much to be wished that every town and district was furnished with
a similar institution; which, if properly conducted, would not
fail to prove of very important benefit to the community.&nbsp;
This therefore is here recorded as forming a favourable trait in
the character of the magistrates and ministers of this town in
the latter part of the reign of Elizabeth.&mdash;But, alas! those
very people, at the same time, were persecuting, burning, and
hanging, (and we may add, <i>murdering</i>) poor ignorant,
friendless and harmless old creatures, under the name of
witches!&mdash;Of this very dark shade, (which together with the
preceding favourable trait exhibit so deplorable an inconsistency
of character,) we shall take some further notice hereafter.</p>
<p>In the next reign, (that of <i>James</i> I,) the obtaining of
a royal Charter, and the recovery of the alienated revenues and
possessions belonging to the Gaywood hospital, (of the latter of
which we have spoken already) seem to have constituted the
principal and most memorable transactions that appertain to this
history.&nbsp; Besides which scarce any thing occurred worthy of
being here recorded, unless it be the erection or establishment
(in 1617) of a <i>Library</i> in the Vestry of <i>St.
Nicholas&rsquo;s Chapel</i>: which appears to have been the first
institution of the kind in this town since the dissolution of the
convents. <a name="citation715"></a><a href="#footnote715"
class="citation">[715]</a>&nbsp; So that for about eighty years,
or ever since the <a name="page716"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
716</span>reformation, the character of the town as a literary,
or bookish place, must have been at a miserable low ebb.&nbsp; We
need not wonder therefore at the extreme ignorance that seemed to
have prevailed here in the mean time.&nbsp; This library is said
to have been founded by the mayor, burgesses, &amp;c.&nbsp; The
library in St. Margaret&rsquo;s Church is said not to have been
founded till about fourteen years after.&nbsp; How extensively
useful these bibliothecal collections proved we have not the
means of ascertaining.&nbsp; At any rate, they were creditable to
those by whom they were projected and promoted.</p>
<p>Upon the accession of <i>Charles</i> I, one of the first and
most remarkable circumstances that appear to have occurred here
was the <i>erection of St. Anne&rsquo;s Fort</i>, on which were
mounted, as we are told, &ldquo;several great pieces of ordnance,
sent from London and planted here for the defence of the
town.&rdquo;&nbsp; This some, perhaps, would be apt to construe
as ominous of the subsequent troubles of that reign, of which
this town appears to have had its full share: for having declared
against the parliament, it was by their forces closely besieged
<a name="page717"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 717</span>and
taken, and afterwards laid under contribution, and strongly
garrisoned.&nbsp; As to the <i>Fort</i>, we cannot find that it
proved of any material use to the town in that time of danger:
nor does it appear to have been ever calculated for the defence
and protection of the place, or for any other purpose but to
please little or full-grown children, who are naturally fond of
ribands and rattles. <a name="citation717"></a><a

<p>About the beginning of 1637, &ldquo;an order came from the
archbishop (Laud) to this town, that the ground at the east end
of the churches should be raised; the communion table (or altar)
placed at the upper end of the churches, under the east windows;
and that they be decently railed in, and steps made to ascend
thereto.&rdquo;&mdash;This was evidently undoing what Elizabeth
and her reformers had done at the beginning of her reign; for the
ground at the upper or east end of the churches was then ordered,
as we have seen, to be levelled with that in the other parts of
them.&nbsp; That queen and her prelates were certainly quite high
enough in their notions about these matters, and yet we see that
they come not nearly up to Charles and Laud.&nbsp; Neither of
these had any dislike to popery, provided they could be
themselves at the head of it.&nbsp; Nor would it be a very easy
matter to point out the time when the spirit of popery was more
predominant, than it was in the church of England <a
name="page718"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 718</span>in the
detestable reign of the first Charles, and under the vile
administration and superintendence of archbishop Laud.&nbsp; The
latter was a sworn and mortal enemy to both civil and religious
liberty, as the whole tenor of his conduct shews.&nbsp; In short,
he was no less superstitious, than intolerant, tyrannical, and
cruel, as this order which he sent to Lynn, and many other parts
of his conduct clearly evince: and he may be very safely said to
have contributed largely to accelerate the ruin of the cause
which he had espoused, and the downfal of the church of which he
was unworthily the chief metropolitan.</p>
<p>Laud has been often represented as very learned: but it was
paying learning but a poor compliment, as it appears to have done
little, or rather nothing at all towards humanizing him, or
softening his hard heart, and subduing the bigotry, intolerance,
and unfeelingness, which were in him so preeminently conspicuous
and predominant.&nbsp; Severities and terrors which most of the
vulgar or unlearned protestant persecutors would have deemed
sufficient, could not satisfy him: cropping or cutting off the
ears, and slitting the noses of those who openly objected to his
proceedings, were among his favourite forms of discipline, and
what passed with him as justifiable and wholesome
severities.&nbsp; His atrocities at last recoiled upon him with a
vengeance, and he became the unpitied victim of his own system of
terror and tyranny.</p>

Lynn and some other places&mdash;inexcusable severity of their
sufferings&mdash;brutality of their persecutors&mdash;barbaric
stupidity and infatuated credulity of the people and their
rulers.</p>
<p>The existence of witches was formerly a part of the creed of
the good people of Lynn, as well as of the rest of their
countrymen.&nbsp; It was not a mere mental error, which would
have made it, at least in a great measure, harmless, but it was a
practical error of a most horrid nature, for it issued in the
persecution and murder of not a few wretched, friendless, and
innocent beings, who were no more in league with satan and the
powers of darkness than their persecutors and judges, or even
half so much.&nbsp; These legal murders were once very common in
this country, even since the reformation: so that many hundreds,
if not thousands of them have been perpetrated under the sanction
of our protestant government, and in the sacred name of justice,
and of our sovereign lord the king.&nbsp; This town, as was
before observed, <a name="page720"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
720</span>is among the places where this innocent blood has been
spilt, and where the names of law, justice, and royalty, have
been shamefully prostituted to justify those foul and murderous
deeds.&nbsp; We shall now proceed to give a sketch of the part
which our townsmen of other times appear to have taken in this
detestable business.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> I.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>A sketch of the history of the prosecution
and murder of divers poor harmless creatures</i>, <i>falsely
denominated witches</i>, <i>at Lynn</i>, <i>in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries</i>.</p>
<p>Before the reformation, and since in popish countries, the
cognizance of reputed <i>witches</i>, and suppression of what is
called <i>witchcraft</i>, pertained to the
<i>inquisitors</i>.&nbsp; <i>Luiz de Paramo</i>, a Spanish
inquisitor, who wrote a most curious book in defence of the holy
office, <a name="citation720"></a><a href="#footnote720"
class="citation">[720]</a> declares <a name="page721"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 721</span>that in the course of 150 years,
(from 1485, if we are not mistaken) the inquisition had
<i>burnt</i> 30,000 <i>witches</i>, which he evidently thought a
most meritorious deed, for which the pious actors were entitled
to the gratitude and veneration of posterity, and himself, who
had been very active in the same way, to the praise of having
deserved well of his country and of all Christendom.</p>
<p>After the reformation, the business, in these kingdoms, was
taken up by such zealous protestants (conformists <a
name="page722"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 722</span>and
nonconformists) whose spirit pretty much resembled that of the
Spanish Inquisitors, and who appear to have been equally
unchristianlike.&nbsp; Their zeal against what they called
witchcraft was unbounded; and whenever they could fix that stigma
upon any one, he could have little chance of escaping with his
life.&nbsp; This country has therefore been highly infamous for
the punishments inflicted, and the barbarities exercised upon
those hapless beings whom our ignorant, superstitious, and savage
ancestors used to brand with the odious names of <i>witches</i>
and <i>wizards</i>.&nbsp; We might well be called to blush for
those execrable deeds of our forefathers, if there were not
others belonging to ourselves which no less loudly call for
blushing.</p>
<p>Lancashire, it seems, has been noted for its reputed witches,
and so has Warboys and other places in Huntingdonshire.&nbsp; Nor
has this town been unproductive of persons who bore the same
name, or had the hard fate of lying under the same
imputation.&mdash;The first of these, that has fallen within the
knowledge of the present writer, was <i>Margaret Read</i>, who is
said to have been <i>burnt</i> here for witchcraft, in
1590.&mdash;Poor creature!&nbsp; She was certainly
<i>murdered</i>! by the magistrates! by what was called the law
of the land, and in the venerable and sacred name of
justice!&nbsp; Such acts, however, have been but too common in
all ages, in all countries, and even in what are called
protestant states.&nbsp; England was then such a state, but that
did not always secure the people from injustice and oppression,
or prevent in all instances the rulers and magistrates from
shedding innocent blood.</p>
<p><a name="page723"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 723</span>About
eight years after, that is, in 1598, one <i>Elizabeth
Housegoe</i> was executed here on the same account: but whether
she was put to death by <i>burning</i>, or by <i>hanging</i>,
does not appear.&nbsp; Whichever it was, it was a most horrid and
detestable deed, and would lead one to shudder at the barbarous
character of our ancestors, but for certain existing
circumstances, which seem too clearly to indicate that we are not
yet got so far beyond them in civilization and humanity as we are
apt sometimes to conceive.&nbsp; Our boasted superiority in those
respects over all modern nations, may also be suspected to be
much less real than imaginary.</p>
<p><i>Mary Smith</i> is the next name that occurs among this
description of hapless sufferers at Lynn.&nbsp; She is said to
have been <i>burnt</i> <a name="citation723a"></a><a
href="#footnote723a" class="citation">[723a]</a> here, on the
12th. of January 1616, for witchcraft, which she was accused of
having practised upon divers persons by means of a vocal contract
with the devil.&nbsp; The poor creature, who no doubt was insane,
acknowledged the truth of these foolish accusations; which
acknowledgement, probably, formed the chief, if not the only
proof of her guilt: and <i>Alexander Roberts</i>, styling himself
<i>preacher of God&rsquo;s Word at King&rsquo;s Linne</i>, in the
same year published a treatise on Witchcraft, in which the story
of this Mary Smith, this pitiable victim of the stupid ignorance
and savage superstition of our ancestors, is related. <a
name="citation723b"></a><a href="#footnote723b"
class="citation">[723b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page724"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 724</span>While
their hands were still red and poluted with the innocent blood of
this poor defenceless woman, our magistrates went about
establishing a Library in the town, which seems indeed to have
been very much wanted among them: and we have already given them
credit for that undertaking.&nbsp; But its inconsistency with the
other part of their conduct is so manifest and glaring
(especially if we join with it their laudable <i>feast of
reconciliation</i>,) that one is apt to wonder that they should
be capable of acting such different parts, or of being the
performers of actions so totally dissimilar and
heterogeneous.&nbsp; It must however be owned that the
inconsistencies of the human character are sometimes very
strange, unaccountable, and surprising.</p>
<p>After the last mentioned affair we hear no more of these
horrid doings at Lynn till 1645, when <i>Dorothy Lee</i>, and
<i>Grace Wright</i>, as Mackerel informs us, were <i>hanged</i>
here for witchcraft.&nbsp; But we suspect that this is misdated,
and that this bloody scene did not take place till the following
year, (1646) as it appears, from the Town Records, that on the
11th. of May, that year, it was &ldquo;ordered that alderman
Thomas Rivett be requested to send for Mr. <i>Hopkins</i>, the
Witch-discoverer, to come to Lynn, and his charges and recompense
to be borne by the town.&rdquo;&nbsp; We may presume that he did
not hesitate to come, and that it was in consequence of his
coming the prosecution and execution of those poor unhappy
creatures took place.&nbsp; It must have been a sad time when
such arch-villains as this Hopkins were caressed by the
magistrates, and employed to assist them in the administration <a
name="page725"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 725</span>of
justice!&mdash;Of him we shall hereafter give some further
account.</p>
<p>Those two women were probably the last that were put to death
here for witchcraft: but great numbers suffered afterwards for
the same imaginary crime in other parts of the kingdom, to the
great disgrace of both the makers and the administrators of our
laws.&nbsp; Even till within these sixty or seventy years, if we
are not mistaken, there have been instances among us of poor
defenceless beings doomed to capital punishment for the same
pretended offence: and though our legislators and rulers seem no
longer to have any faith in the existence of witches, yet the
common people in many places are as much in that belief as ever,
and would be very glad, no doubt, to have the old sanguinary laws
still put in execution.&nbsp; A melancholy instance of the
present existence of such a superstitious belief among our
country people occurred but about two years ago at Great Paxton
in Huntingdonshire, of which we shall, perhaps, in another place
take some further notice.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> II.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Brief account of some of the principal</i>
witch-finders, <i>or</i> witch discoverers, <i>as they were
sometimes called</i>, <i>those pests of society</i>, <i>who were
a disgrace to the country and to the age in which they
lived</i>.</p>
<p>It would appear perhaps incredible, that those infernal beings
called witch-finders should ever have been tolerated <a
name="page726"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 726</span>and
encouraged in any country calling itself christian and
protestant, had we not seen characters no less detestable and
diabolical countenanced, caressed, and patronised in such
countries.&nbsp; The execrable reign of Charles II swarmed with
<i>Spies</i> and <i>informers</i>, whose talents were employed to
promote religious uniformity, and suppress liberty of
conscience.&nbsp; Like the witch finders, they were countenanced
by the magistrates, patronized by the gentry, and enriched by the
wages of unrighteousness, and the ruin of innocent persons and
families.&nbsp; Our own time has seen such wretches, and poor
Ireland has been not a little prolific of them.&nbsp; Even among
our financial or revenue agents some of the same family have made
their appearance, which some are apt to consider as an evil and a
grievance of no small magnitude.&nbsp; If our own time has
abounded with such characters, and if they have been really
countenanced and cherished by rulers and magistrates, we must not
be too severe upon our ancestors for the course which they
pursued in regard to those called witches and witch-finders: for
we do not seem to have yet gone so far beyond them in wisdom and
virtue as we are sometimes apt to think.</p>
<p>Among those called witch-finders, the first place seems due to
<i>Matthew Hopkins</i>, of Maningtree, in Essex, who has been
already mentioned, as invited here by the magistrates, to assist
them in the discovery, or detection and conviction of witches,
and the suppression of witchcraft.&nbsp; This man, as we are
told, was witch-finder for the associated counties, (Essex,
Suffolk, and Norfolk,) and hanged in one year no less than
<i>sixty</i> reputed witches <a name="page727"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 727</span>in his own county.&nbsp; The old,
the ignorant, and the indigent; such as could neither plead their
own cause nor hire an advocate; were the miserable victims of
this wretch&rsquo;s avarice and villany.&nbsp; He pretended to be
a great critic in <i>special marks</i>; which were only moles,
scorbutic spots, or warts, which frequently grew large and
pendulous in old age, but were absurdly supposed to be teats to
suckle imps.&nbsp; His ultimate method of proof was by tying
together the thumbs and toes of the suspected person, about whose
waist was fastened a cord, the ends of which were held, on the
banks of a river, by two persons, in whose power it was to
straighten or slacken it.&nbsp; <i>Swimming</i>, upon this
experiment, was deemed a full proof of guilt; for which king
James, (who is said to have recommended it, if he did not invent
it,) assigned the following sage reason: &ldquo;That as such
persons have renounced their baptism by water, so the water
refuses to receive them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sometimes those who were
accused of diabolical practices were tied neck and heels and
tossed into a pond.&nbsp; If they floated they were consequently
guilty, and therefore taken out and burnt: if they were
<i>innocent</i> they were only <i>drowned</i>.&nbsp; The
experiment of <i>swimming</i> was at length tried upon Hopkins
himself, in his own way, and he was in the event condemned, and,
as it seems, executed as a wizard; <a name="citation727"></a><a
href="#footnote727" class="citation">[727]</a> an end or
retribution which he appears to have richly merited.&nbsp; But
how far he was (if at all) convinced of that, at his exit, we are
not informed.&nbsp; If we are not <a name="page728"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 728</span>mistaken, there was also, about the
same time, a noted witch-finder at <i>Ipswich</i>, who found
pretty full employment, but as we have no account either of his
mode of proceeding or exploits, or yet of his exit, we can say no
more about him.</p>
<p>At the time when the belief and detestation of witchcraft were
universal in this country there can be no doubt but the number of
our pretended witch-finders was very considerable.&nbsp; It may
be fairly supposed that there were more than one for every
county, and even that they were no less numerous than our modern
mountebanks and quack doctors.&nbsp; Some of them, however,
would, in the natural course of things, outshine the rest, or far
excel them in point of reputation or celebrity.&nbsp; Such a one
was Hopkins, and such a one was that famous Scotchman, whose name
we cannot at present make out, who found so much employment, in
the way of his vile vocation, on this, as well as on the other
side of the Tweed.&nbsp; Of him a curious account is given in a
book entitled, England&rsquo;s Grievance, &amp;c. by <i>Ralph
Gardiner</i>, Gent. of Chirton, in Northumberland.&nbsp; London:
printed in 1655.&nbsp; Reprinted in 1796.&nbsp; Where we have the
following information.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In or about the year 1649 or 1650, the
magistrates of Newcastle upon Tyne sent two of their sergeants,
namely Thomas Shevel, and Cuthbert Nicholson, into Scotland, to
agree with a Scotchman, who pretended knowledge to finde out
witches by pricking them with pins, to come to Newcastle, where
he should try such who should be brought to him, and have
20<i>s.</i> a-piece <a name="page729"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 729</span>for all he could condemn (or
convict) as witches, and free passage thither and back again:
[i.e. have his expenses borne to and fro.]&nbsp; When the
sergeants had brought this witch-finder on horseback to town, the
magistrates sent their bellman through the town ringing his bell,
and crying, all people that would bring in any complaint against
any woman for a witch, they should be sent for and tryed by the
person appointed.&nbsp; <i>Thirty</i> women were [accordingly]
brought into the town-hall and stript, and then openly had pins
thrust into their bodies, and most of them was (were) found
guilty by him, and set aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The said reputed witch-finder acquainted colonel Hobson
that he knew women, whether they were witches or no, by their
looks; and when he was searching a personable and good-like [or
good looking] woman, the said colonel replied and said, Surely,
this woman in none, and need not be tryed: but the scotchman said
she was, for the town said she was, and therefore he would try
her; and presently, in sight of all the people, laid her body
naked to the waste, [waist] with her cloaths over her head; by
which fright and shame all her blood contracted into one part of
her body, and then he ran a pin into her thigh, and suddenly let
her coats fall, and then demanded whither she had nothing of his
in her body, but did not bleed?&nbsp; But she being amazed,
replied little.&nbsp; Then he put his hands up her coats and
pulled out the pin, setting her aside, as a guilty person and
child of the devil, and fell to try others, whom he made
guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page730"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
730</span>&ldquo;Colonel Hobson perceiving the alteration of the
foresaid woman, by her blood settling in her right parts, caused
her to be brought again, and her cloaths pulled up to her thigh,
and required the scot to run the pin into the same place, and
then it gushed out of blood, and the said scot cleared her, and
said she was not a child of the devil.&nbsp; So soon as he had
done, and received his wages, he went into Northumberland to try
women there, where he got of some 3<i>l.</i> a-piece.&nbsp; But
Henry Ogle Esq. a late member of parliament, laid hold on him,
and required bond of him, to answer the sessions, but he got away
for Scotland, and it was conceived, if he had staid, he would
have made most of the women in the north witches, for
money.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poor Newcastle women, whom this wretch had set aside and
pronounced guilty, were put in prison till the assizes, when 14
of them, and <i>one man</i>, were condemned, and afterwards
executed: all solemnly protesting their innocence.&nbsp; Their
names are mentioned at page 115 of the said book.&nbsp; The truth
of the above account is attested by three persons, whose names it
is needless to insert here.&mdash;As to the infamous witch-finder
himself, we are told that &ldquo;he was afterwards taken up in
Scotland, cast into prison, indicted, arraigned, and condemned
for such like villanie exercised in Scotland: and on the gallows
confessed he had been the death of above 220 women, in England
and Scotland, for the gain of 20<i>s.</i> a-piece, and beseeched
forgiveness, and was executed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author of the work from which this account is extracted,
indignantly inquires, &ldquo;by what law the magistrates <a
name="page731"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 731</span>of
Newcastle could send to another nation for a mercenary person to
try women for witches? and set the bellman to cry for them to be
brought in?&mdash;and give 20<i>s.</i> a piece to the former to
condemn them?&rdquo;&nbsp; These queries we know not how to
answer, but by supposing that the whole was a <i>lawless</i>, as
well as a most iniquitous, barbarous, and scandalous
business.&nbsp; The magistrates of Newcastle certainly appear on
this occasion a vile and infamous crew, whose memory ought to be
held up to the horror of perpetual detestation.&nbsp; How much
better the magistrates of Lynn would have appeared, had we so
particular an account of their proceedings, when they sent for
Hopkins, it is impossible now to say.&nbsp; Their conduct, to say
the least of it, appears sufficiently dark and despicable.</p>
<p>While we feel and express a just indignation against the
witchfinders, as well as against the spies and informers and such
like miscreants, we ought not to forget how much the existence,
sufferance, and employment of them reflect on the character of
the rulers and magistrates of those days, and even of the nation,
or public at large; for had these been sufficiently enlightened
and humanized, those detestable wretches had never been
encouraged and employed, or even endured in the country.&nbsp;
How baleful and deplorable therefore must intellectual blindness
or ignorance be in any community? how desirable, important, and
necessary for all descriptions of men, is the true knowledge of
their respective rights and duties!&nbsp; Had our magistrates and
legislators always possessed that knowledge, and acted
accordingly, our <a name="page732"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
732</span>annals had never been disgraced, as they are, with the
recital of so many acts of injustice and oppression, or with such
shocking accounts of the torturing, burning, and hanging of so
many reputed criminals, under the misapplied and odious names of
witches, heretics, and blasphemers.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> III.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Additional observations on Witchcraft</i>,
<i>and on the absurd and superstitious notions entertained by our
ancestors concerning witches</i>, <i>as well as their deep-rooted
and deadly antipathy against all those whom they considered as
such</i>.</p>
<p>That the world abounded in former ages, and from the remotest
periods, with jugglers and other sorts of artful impostors, who
pretended to the knowledge of future events and other secrets,
and so supported themselves and acquired great names by working
upon the weakness, or imposing upon the credulity of mankind, is
well known.&nbsp; Being of different sorts they went under
different names, according to their respective pretensions, or
peculiar, apparent, or professed modes of proceeding.&nbsp; Hence
we speak of them under the various appellations of magicians,
sorcerers, diviners, conjurers, witches and wizards, &amp;c.
each, or most of which denote a certain distinction of character
or operation. <a name="citation732"></a><a href="#footnote732"
class="citation">[732]</a>&nbsp; There were <a
name="page733"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 733</span>among them
from the earliest times ventriloquists and consummate jugglers,
well skilled in the arts of dexterity, or slight of hand tricks,
and their operations served, (as real miracles did with the true
prophets,) to gain credit to their declarations and
pretensions.&nbsp; Thus their high and solemn professions, with
the aid of gastriloquy, legerdemain or juggling, obtained credit
in the world, so as to establish their character or fame, and
perpetuate the delusion.&nbsp; Falshood assumed the name or place
of truth, and fiction that of reality: and those who were thus
taken in, or imposed upon, have always with difficulty been
undeceived.</p>
<p>Formerly the names of magicians, sorcerers, witches, &amp;c.
were appropriated to those only who avowed or professed
themselves to be such; but latterly, or in more recent times,
they seem to have been chiefly, if not entirely appropriated to
those who did <i>not</i> make such an avowal or profession, and
who even disclaimed any such imputation or pretension.&nbsp; And,
what is exceedingly remarkable, those who were uncommonly
knowing, and those who were uncommonly ignorant became <a
name="page734"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 734</span>now equally
the objects of suspicion, and were of course included under one
or another of those appellations; as if extraordinary
intelligence and extraordinary stupidity equally indicated an
alliance or confederacy with the devil.&nbsp; Such men as
<i>Roger Bacon</i> and <i>Galileo</i>, the most enlightened of
their species, were more than suspected to be <i>sorcerers</i>,
and multitudes of poor creatures, mostly old women, who were no
way distinguished from the rest of the community, except by their
extreme poverty, or extreme ignorance, have been treated in the
most brutal manner, and in the end burnt or hanged, under the
opprobrious name of <i>witches</i>&mdash;in the infamy of which
conduct, as we have shewn, this town is deeply implicated.</p>
<p>Before the reformation there was, it seems, in this country a
regular board of justice, for the constant apprehension and
conviction of magicians, enchanters, sorcerers, witches, &amp;c.
and a warrant is said to be still extant for the seizing of one
Thomas Northfield, <i>professor of divinity</i>, and
<i>sorcerer</i>, with all his books and instruments. <a
name="citation734a"></a><a href="#footnote734a"
class="citation">[734a]</a>&nbsp; This double character, of
conjurer and divine, exhibits the poor fellow in a queer kind of
light, as a sort of amphibious animal.&nbsp; What he was as a
divine, it is impossible now to ascertain.&nbsp; He might be
eminent, or he might not. <a name="citation734b"></a><a
href="#footnote734b" class="citation">[734b]</a>&nbsp; But his
being also a sorcerer or conjurer, in the usual acceptations of
those <a name="page735"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
735</span>words, seems no way entitled to credit; so that his
lying under that imputation, or his being so reputed, was merely
the effect of the blind superstition which then prevailed, and
which usually ascribed every appearance of superior genius or
intelligence to a diabolical inspiration.</p>
<p>After the reformation, the rage against witches and sorcerers
underwent no abatement.&nbsp; New laws were enacted against them,
and reputed offenders were prosecuted with the utmost
rigour.&nbsp; The most learned of our sovereigns, (Henry VIII.
and James I.) not only strongly believed in the existence of such
offenders, but likewise held them in the greatest abhorrence:
Hence by statute 33 Henry VIII, c. 8. witchcraft and sorcery are
made felony without benefit of clergy; and by statute 1 Jac. 1.
c. 12. it is enacted, &ldquo;that all persons invoking any evil
spirit, or consulting, covenanting with, entertaining, employing,
<i>feeding</i>, or <i>rewarding</i> any evil spirit; or taking up
dead bodies from their graves to be used in any witchcraft,
sorcery, charm, or enchantment; or killing, or otherwise hurting
any person by such infernal arts; should be guilty of felony
without benefit of clergy, and suffer death.&nbsp; And if any
person should attempt by sorcery to discover hidden treasure, or
to restore stolen goods, or to provoke unlawful love, or to hurt
any man or beast, though the same were not effected, he or she
should suffer imprisonment and pillory for the first offence, and
death for the second.&rdquo;&nbsp; These acts (judge Blackstone
says) <a name="page736"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
736</span>&ldquo;continued in force till lately, to the terror of
all ancient females in the kingdom: and many poor wretches were
sacrificed to the prejudice of their neighbours and their own
illusion; not a few having, by some means or other, confessed the
fact at the gallows.&nbsp; But (he adds,) all executions for this
dubious crime are now at an end.&nbsp; Accordingly it is with us
enacted by statute 9 Geo. II. c. 5. that no prosecution shall be
carried on against any person for conjuration, witchcraft,
sorcery, or inchantment. <a name="citation736a"></a><a
href="#footnote736a" class="citation">[736a]</a>&nbsp; But the
misdemeanor of persons pretending to use witchcraft, tell
fortunes, or discover stolen goods by skill in the occult
sciences, is still deservedly punished with a year&rsquo;s
imprisonment, and standing four times in the pillory.&rdquo; <a
name="citation736b"></a><a href="#footnote736b"
class="citation">[736b]</a></p>
<p>Thus it appears that it was not till the last reign that the
sanguinary laws against witchcraft &amp;c. were repealed in this
country; so that we had enjoyed the light of the reformation full
200 years before we discerned the injustice and bloodguiltiness
of those laws, or even the folly and absurdity of believing that
those poor, ignorant, defenceless women, whom we were pleased to
call witches, had actually sold their souls and bodies to the <a
name="page737"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 737</span>devil, and
had in exchange obtained from him the power of working
miracles.&nbsp; For we always imputed to our witches a
supernatural power, which we deemed one of their essential
characteristics: and we firmly believed that they could fly, or
ride in the air upon broomsticks, change themselves into the form
of other animals, injure their neighbours in their persons or
property, by their looks, their thoughts, or their wishes,
&amp;c.&nbsp; Now, if not only the public at large and the
juries, but even the judges and legislators could believe all
this, what wonder is it if some of the poor old women could do so
too, as they are said to have sometimes made such a
confession?&nbsp; Their confession, however, appears to have been
often, if not always, the mere effect of terror and confusion. <a
name="citation737"></a><a href="#footnote737"
class="citation">[737]</a>&nbsp; Poor hapless creatures! without
a friend in the world to take their part, or speak a word in
their behalf; terrified also and confounded beyond measure by the
presence of their judge and the awful apparatus of a court of
Justice, they would confess any thing that might be urged upon
them, and all without thought or reflection, or even knowing what
they said.</p>
<p>It is not unworthy of observation that witches were formerly,
even by our legislators, classed with heretics, and witchcraft
went under the name of heresy, being <a name="page738"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 738</span>deemed a species of that offence,
and subjected to the same punishment, that of
<i>burning</i>.&nbsp; It might quite as well have gone under the
name of <i>rebellion</i> or <i>high treason</i>, or any other
crime, for it has as much affinity with them, to the full, as it
has with heresy.&nbsp; It is astonishing how often, or how
commonly it is that human laws and governments are characterized
by ignorance, absurdity, injustice, cruelty, <i>folly</i> and
<i>madness</i>.&nbsp; So unfortunate in general has the world
been in its rulers, that most of them have proved its greatest
enemies, though often extolled to the skies, for every imaginable
excellence, by the vile sycophants that surround them, and the
vermin of every province and district who live and fatten on
their oppressive and rapacious devices.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> IV.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Summary view of the whole
subject&mdash;account of proceedings against witches in this
country till the repeal of the laws that chiefly affected
them&mdash;hints on the present state of the nation in regard to
this and its kindred delusions</i>.</p>
<p>The proper idea of <i>witchcraft</i>, it is presumed, has been
already very plainly suggested; but lest it should not seem
sufficiently clear to our readers in general, it may be proper to
attempt here a more explicit definition.&nbsp; We say therefore
that witchcraft is a supernatural power <a
name="page739"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 739</span>which
persons were supposed to obtain the possession of by entering
into compact with the devil.&nbsp; It was believed that they had
given themselves up to him body and soul; and that he engaged on
his part that they should want for nothing, and that he would
avenge them upon all their enemies:&mdash;also, that as soon as
the bargain was concluded, the devil delivered up to the witch an
imp, or familiar spirit, to be ready at a call and do whatever it
was directed.&nbsp; By the assistance of this imp and the devil
together, [that is, of both the young devil and the old one,] the
witch, who was almost always an old woman, was enabled, as it was
firmly believed, to do very marvellous feats&mdash;even to
transport herself in the air, on a broomstick or a spit, to
distant places to attend the assemblies or meetings of the
witches; for, according to this belief, or way of thinking, the
witches, (like some of our modern sects,) actually had their
<i>assemblies</i>, <i>associations</i>, or general
<i>conferences</i>, at which the devil himself always
presided.&nbsp; It was also believed that they were enabled to
transform themselves into various shapes, particularly to assume
the forms of <i>cats</i> and <i>hares</i>, in which they most
delighted; to inflict diseases on whomsoever they thought proper;
and to punish their enemies in a variety of ways. <a
name="citation739"></a><a href="#footnote739"
class="citation">[739]</a>&nbsp; These ideas of witchery could
not obtain belief among the heathens, as they had no knowledge of
our <i>devil</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page740"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 740</span>Under
popish darkness and delusion these views of witchcraft
universally obtained in Europe till the 16th century, and the
doctrine maintained its ground with tolerable firmness till after
the middle of the seventeenth, and even till the former part of
the eighteenth century, when it was obliged to give way to more
rational views of things.&nbsp; Vast numbers of reputed witches
were here, in <i>protestant</i> and <i>evangelical England</i>,
convicted and condemned to be burnt every year; and a man who had
the hardihood to deny the doctrine, or doubt of its truth, would
be at once suspected of atheism, and perhaps run the risk of
being burnt, if not for downright witchcraft, yet at least for
advocating the cause, and being the agent of his Satanic majesty.
<a name="citation740"></a><a href="#footnote740"
class="citation">[740]</a></p>
<p>Of the <i>methods of discovering witches</i>, one was to weigh
the supposed criminal against the <i>church bible</i>, which, if
she was guilty, would preponderate.&nbsp; Another method was by
making her attempt to say the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer; this no witch
was able to repeat entirely, but would omit some part or other:
all witches did not hesitate at the same place; some leaving out
one part and some another.&mdash;It was also believed that
witches always said their prayers
<i>backwards</i>.&mdash;<i>Teats</i>, though which the imps
suckled, were indubitable marks of a witch: these were always
raw, and also insensible; and, if squeezed, sometimes yielded a
drop of blood.&nbsp; A witch could not weep more than three
tears, and that only out of the left eye.&nbsp; This want of
tears was, by <a name="page741"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
741</span>the witchfinders, and even by some <i>judges</i>,
considered as a very substantial proof of guilt.&nbsp;
<i>Swimming</i> a witch, as was before observed, was another kind
of popular ordeal generally practised: for this she was stript
naked, and cross bound, the right thumb to the left toe, and the
left thumb to the right toe.&nbsp; Thus prepared, she was thrown
into a pond or river, in which, if guilty, she could not sink;
for having, as was said before, by her compact with the devil,
renounced the benefit of the water of baptism, that element, in
its turn, renounced her, and refused to receive her into its
bosom.</p>
<p>The trial by <i>stool</i>, another method for the discovery of
witches, was thus managed: having taken the suspected witch, she
was placed in the middle of a room upon a stool or table, cross
legged, or in some other uneasy posture; to which if she
submitted not, she was bound with cords: there she was watched,
and kept without food or sleep, for twenty four hours; for it was
believed that they should within that time see her imp come and
suck.&nbsp; A little hole was therefore made in the door for the
imp to come in at: and lest he should come in a less discernible
shape, they that watched were taught to be frequently sweeping
the room, and, if they saw any <i>spiders</i> or <i>flies</i>, to
kill them; if they could not kill them, then they might be sure
they were <i>imps</i>.</p>
<p>If witches, under examination or torture, would not confess,
all their apparel was changed, and every hair of their body
shaven off with a sharp razor, lest they should secrete magical
charms to prevent their confessing.&nbsp; <a
name="page742"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 742</span>Witches
were believed to be most apt to confess on
<i>Fridays</i>.&mdash;The two following expedients, or fiery
ordeals, are also mentioned, as used to extort confession: the
first, burning the thatch of the house of the suspected witch;
the other, burning any animal supposed to be bewitched by her, as
a hog or ox.&nbsp; These, it was held would force a witch to
confess, <a name="citation742"></a><a href="#footnote742"
class="citation">[742]</a> in spite of her teeth, or of the
devil.&mdash;Our ancestors, strange as it may seem, persisted in
the belief and practice, or observance of these horrid
monstrosities till within the memory of some of the present
generation.&nbsp; Nor had they perhaps relinquished or abandoned
them quite so soon, but for the laudable exertions of such men as
Locke and Addison, and their enlightened contemporaries.</p>
<p>Our kings, courtiers, and legislators were all believers in
witchcraft, and hearty approvers of the existing laws against
that reputed crime.&nbsp; One of the former, and deemed the
<i>wisest</i> of that sacred order, and the <i>Solomon</i> of his
day, (James I,) wrote a book in defence of that belief, and of
subjecting witches to capital punishment; and when <i>Reginald
Scott</i>, the first of our countrymen who ventured to dissent
froth the popular creed and write on the other side of the
question, published his book, his majesty ordered it to be
<i>burnt</i> by the common hangman.&nbsp; The whole nation
approved of the royal and <a name="page743"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 743</span>magnanimous deed, and poor Scott
passed for a notorious heretic.&mdash;It is not a little
mortifying and humiliating to the dignity and pride of man, that
the same stupid and absurd notions about witchcraft were among
the articles of the creed of the great lord <i>Bacon</i> and his
most enlightened contemporaries, as well as of their wise
sovereign, and the whole body of the mobility or national
rabblement.&nbsp; The poor witches, of course, had then almost
terrible time of it; as much so, probably, to the full, as in the
darkest days of popery.</p>
<p>Under Charles I, the Common-wealth, and succeeding reigns, the
public opinion on this subject continued unchanged, and the
judicial proceedings against witches went on as before.&nbsp; If
they exceeded at any particular period, we presume it must have
been under the <i>Common-wealth</i>, when the witch-finders
appear to have been in full employment, and at the height of
their prosperity.&nbsp; But we can hardly give credit to the
account which Dr. Zachary Grey said he had seen, of between 3 and
4000 persons who suffered death, in the British dominions, for
witchcraft, from the year 1640 to 1660.&nbsp; The spirit which
then predominated and reigned, was certainly violent enough, and
bore cruelly hard on the poor creatures who were accused of
witchcraft: but such a number of victims in so short a space of
time, is surely too excessive and extravagant to be
credited.&nbsp; It is however greatly to be regretted that the
leaders of that interesting period adhered in this particular to
the creed of their ancestors, and were so stupidly in the dark as
they appear to have been on this and some other subjects.</p>
<p><a name="page744"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 744</span>It
does not appear, as far as the present writer has discovered,
that any of the <i>judges</i>, till after the revolution, shewed
the least inclination to discountenance the prosecution of
reputed witches, or the prevailing and popular notions about
witchcraft.&nbsp; Even <i>Sir Matthew Hale</i> went with the
stream of public opinion, and was among those oracles of the law
who passed, without hesitation, the sentence of death on those
whom the verdict of a jury pronounced guilty of that reputed
crime.&nbsp; <i>Sir John Holt</i> and <i>Sir John Powel</i>, to
their immortal honour, appear to have been the first of our
English judges who viewed this pretended offence with minds
superior to vulgar prejudice.&nbsp; The conduct of the former, on
a certain trial for that offence, is said to have been such as
put an end to all similar prosecutions in that part of the
country, and even throughout the kingdom. <a
name="citation744"></a><a href="#footnote744"
class="citation">[744]</a>&nbsp; But the law was not repealed or
altered in his time.</p>
<p><a name="page745"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 745</span>As to
the latter, (Judge Powel,) we hear of two different trials for
this offence before him.&nbsp; At one of them, a witness gave
evidence that the prisoner at the bar could <i>fly</i>: on which
the judge asked the poor woman, if it really was so, and she
answered in the affirmative; <a name="page746"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 746</span>when the judge, with a promptitude
of expression which evinced the superiority of his understanding,
told her, so she might if she would; he knew of no law against
it.&nbsp; How this trial ended we are not told; but we may be
very sure that his lordship did all he could to get the prisoner
acquitted.&nbsp; The other trial for witchcraft before him was
that of <i>Jane Wenham</i>, at Hertford, March 4. 1712.&nbsp; The
prisoner was charged with having bewitched several persons, and
had the weakness, it seems, sometime before the trial, to confess
herself guilty of the alleged crime: and though she afterwards
accounted for this confession, as arising from terror, it appears
to have had considerable influence on the minds of the jury, in
spite of the endeavours of the humane judge to explain and
invalidate the evidence brought against her.&nbsp; She was
accordingly brought in guilty; but the judge reprieved her, and
the queen soon after pardoned her.</p>
<p>One of the principal witnesses against the prisoner on this
trial, as well as one of the principal writers in the controversy
to which it gave rise, was Mr. Bragge, vicar of Hitchin.&nbsp;
This gentlemen, in his evidence on the trial, declared, on
&ldquo;the faith of a clergyman,&rdquo; that &ldquo;he believed
the prisoner to be a witch:&rdquo; whereupon the judge told him,
that, therefore, &ldquo;on the Truth of a Judge, he took him to
be no conjurer.&rdquo;&nbsp; After she was pardoned, a gentleman
in the country provided her an apartment over his stables, sent
her victuals from his table, and suffered her to attend on his
children: and we are informed that she was ever after looked upon
<a name="page747"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 747</span>by the
family as an honest, good natured woman. <a
name="citation747a"></a><a href="#footnote747a"
class="citation">[747a]</a>&nbsp; Here we will venture to add
that the conduct of the judge and the queen was as just and
commendable as that of the prosecutors and the jury was vile and
infamous.</p>
<p>In 1716, about four years after the above trial, came on at
Huntingdon, for the same offence, before judge <i>Wilmot</i>, the
trial of <i>Mary Hicks</i> and <i>Elizabeth</i> her daughter,
<i>nine</i> years of age.&nbsp; They were, it seems, the wife and
favourite child of a substantial farmer, who had them
apprehended, and became himself, most unnaturally, the principal
prosecutor.&nbsp; The child had practised some silly illusions on
her father&rsquo;s weakness, and the mother had had recourse to
the antiquated folly of killing her neighbours in effigy.&nbsp;
On this the suspicion of their being witches was founded.&nbsp; A
confession on their part, not only corroborated that suspicion,
but was taken as a full proof of their guilt: &ldquo;and judge
Wilmot suffered them to be hanged, upon that confession, four
years (says Mr. Gough,) after his wiser brother, (judge Powel,)
ventured his own life to save that of the old woman at
Hertford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About twenty years after the date of this disgraceful and
tragical trial, the 9th. of Geo. II, the old laws which made
witchcraft a capital crime were happily repealed.&nbsp; How many
more of such prosecutions or executions took place within those
twenty years we are not able to say. <a
name="citation747b"></a><a href="#footnote747b"
class="citation">[747b]</a>&nbsp; But it does not appear that the
inhabitants <a name="page748"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
748</span>in general, or the lower orders of the community which
constitute the bulk of the nation, have ever yet been fully
satisfied with the repeal of those laws.&nbsp; Hence they have
been often ready to take the business into their own hands and
proceed in a summary and very savage way against those whom they
have thought proper to deem or denominate witches.&nbsp; A
shocking case of this kind occurred at <i>Fring</i> in
<i>Hertfordshire</i> as lately as 1751, when one <i>Ruth
Osborn</i>, a reputed witch, fell a victim to the stupid
credulity and abominable prejudice of a frantic mob: and though
several of the ringleaders in that bloody and brutal transaction
were afterwards hanged, yet the blind and superstitious belief
that produced it remained still in the country, and is, even now,
in many, if not in most parts of the kingdom as strong as
ever.</p>
<p>But little more than two years ago, as was observed before,
one <i>Ann Izzard</i>, a poor, honest, industrious woman, of
Great Paxton in Huntingdonshire, was very near meeting the same
fate with the above Ruth Osborn.&nbsp; Two or three young women
in the neighbourhood having fits, some people there gave out,
that they were bewitched, and the suspicion fell upon Ann Izzard:
a loaded cart sometime after, oversetting on its return from St.
Neot&rsquo;s market, while the same woman was in company, that
accident was ascribed to her witchery.&nbsp; This confirmed and
established the public opinion of her being actually a witch, and
immediately set the whole parish in an uproar: &ldquo;She has
just overturned a loaded cart with as much ease as if it had <a
name="page749"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 749</span>been a
spinning wheel,&rdquo; was echoed from one end of it to the
other.&nbsp; Men, women, and children raised their voices and
exclaimed, &ldquo;we have now sufficient proof of her
guilt&mdash;this last act in open day speaks for itself&mdash;she
is the person that does all the mischief; and if something is not
done to put a stop to her baseness there will be no living in the
place.&rdquo;&mdash;Nor did this fit of phrensy terminate till
they had made two attacks upon her, which, atrocious as they
appeared to rational and enlightened people, where considered, by
themselves as not only justifiable but highly meritorious.&nbsp;
They were proceeding to still greater atrocities, which she
escaped through the interposition of some of her more humane
neighbours, who took her under their protection, and had the
offenders prosecuted. <a name="citation749"></a><a
href="#footnote749" class="citation">[749]</a></p>
<p><a name="page750"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 750</span>But
let us not suppose that it is only in <i>Hertfordshire</i> and
<i>Huntingdonshire</i> that this stupid belief in the existence
of witches still maintains its ground among us: there every
reason to conclude, for all our boasted advancement in knowledge,
that a large majority of our population is still subject to this
stupidity, and strong in the faith of witchcraft.&nbsp; It is
much to be wished we could here make an exception in favour of
<i>Norfolk</i>, and particularly of <i>Lynn</i>.&nbsp; But it
cannot be done.&nbsp; A great part of this county is known to be
exceedingly dark and heathenish; and the vicinity of this town
may be said to be much in the same predicament.&nbsp; Even of the
town itself the majority of the population appear to be in a
miserable low estate, in point of moral as well as religious
cultivation.&nbsp; It is therefore not to be wondered at if a
belief in such things as witchcraft and conjuration should be
here still very common and prevalent.</p>
<p><a name="page751"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 751</span>The
author presumes that there is no need to apologize for the length
of these historical strictures on witchcraft; the belief of it
being, even now, so general among us.&nbsp; As he deems it a
vulgar error, or popular delusion of a most disgraceful
character, and pernicious tendency, he wished to expose it with
effect, which he thought he could not do more briefly.&nbsp; He
has long observed, with regret, how tenaciously a large
proportion of the population of this town and country still
adhere to their old blind prejudices; and he would gladly
contribute, as far as he can, towards weakening that
adherence.&nbsp; The success, indeed, of all efforts in this way
seems almost hopeless; our countrymen&rsquo;s progress here, from
darkness to light, having been hitherto so exceedingly slow and
sluggish.&nbsp; A belief in the existence or reality of
conjuration and witchcraft, and in the almost boundless power and
dominion of a malignant being, called the <i>devil</i>, is yet,
even now in the nineteenth century, among our deep-rooted
delusions.&nbsp; That it is really so, might be exemplified and
proved from many undeniable facts, as well as some very recent
and striking occurrences. <a name="citation751"></a><a
href="#footnote751" class="citation">[751]</a>&nbsp; But we will
<a name="page752"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 752</span>now
dismiss the subject, and proceed to another division of the work,
where new scenes will present themselves to our view.</p>

753</span>CHAP. IV.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">History of Lynn, from the meeting of the long
parliament, and the commencement of the civil war, to the
Restoration.</p>
<p>The long parliament, during the first years of its existence,
exhibited, perhaps, a body of national representatives, the most
respectable in point of talents and integrity, that this country
could ever boast of, or has at any time produced.&nbsp; Between
the patriotism of that assembly and the despotism of the court;
there was certainly a most visible and striking contrast.&nbsp;
The difference between these patriots and the government, arose
from the oppressive proceedings of the latter, and their flagrant
encroachments upon the rights and liberties of the people.&nbsp;
The patriots heartily espoused the people&rsquo;s cause; but as
their oppressors would not listen to reason, or cease from their
tyranny, and give security for their future good behaviour, an
appeal was made to the sword, which produced the civil war, of
which, together with its memorable effects or consequences, <a
name="page754"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 754</span>especially
as they affected, or related to this town, we shall now proceed
to lay before the reader a brief account, which will enable him
to form some idea of the principal occurrences of that
period.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> I.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Hints relating to some occurrences
here</i>, <i>anterior to the breaking out of the war&mdash;Lynn
declares for the king&mdash;its previous conduct charged with
duplicity&mdash;siege and surrender of the town&mdash;subsequent
events</i>.</p>
<p>Among the arbitrary measures of the government, which affected
this town previously to the commencement of the war, was the
levying of <i>Ship-money</i>.&nbsp; In 1634, the town is said to
have been assessed towards a ship of 800 tons, with 260 men; but
it does not appear what was the amount of the assessment.&nbsp;
Two years after, however, (Nov. 6. 1637,) we learn, from the
corporation books, that &ldquo;the town was assessed 200<i>l.</i>
for a ship of war.&rdquo;&nbsp; This sum may be supposed nearly,
if not quite equal to 2000<i>l.</i> of our money.&nbsp; We mean
not to say that it was excessive or exorbitant: it was certainly
arbitrary, and therefore illegal and objectionable.&nbsp; But by
the heads of the town, if we may judge by their subsequent
conduct, it was not deemed a serious grievance, or perhaps any
grievance at all; for they declared for the court, and against
the party which opposed those lawless exactions.</p>
<p><a name="page755"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 755</span>In
the succeeding years, previously to the commencement of the war,
the town appears to have been closely and carefully guarded, so
that none were allowed to enter without permission: hence we find
in 1639, the mayor appointing &ldquo;two warders for the day
time, one to stand at the South, and the other the
East-Gate;&rdquo; and the same to continue, &ldquo;so long as he
shall think fitting these dangerous times.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1640
and 1641, the town may be supposed guarded no less vigilantly; in
the beginning of 1642, it was, it seems, further fortified, and
furnished with seven pieces of brass cannon from London.&nbsp; In
the early part of the same year, captain <i>Sherwood</i> of
Norwich, at the head of a troop of dragoons, came close under
<i>St. Catherine&rsquo;s Wall</i>, by the East-Gate, and demanded
admittance, but was denied, says Mackerel, &ldquo;by the mayor
and townsmen&rdquo;&mdash;but we presume it must have been rather
by the <i>governor</i>; who, at that time, if we are not
mistaken, was <i>Sir Hamon L&rsquo;Estrange</i>, the father of
the afterwards famous <i>Sir Roger</i>.</p>
<p>The three gates were now furnished with draw-bridges, and the
town, from its situation and the repairs bestowed on its
fortifications, must have been pretty strong.&nbsp; The
parliament also thought it a place of no small consequence, and
therefore it was besieged and taken at an early stage of the war,
by the earl of Manchester, one of their commanders, at the head
of a very respectable and formidable force, well supplied with
artillery.&nbsp; The town held out near three weeks; for the
siege began on August 28. and the place surrendered <a
name="page756"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 756</span>on the
16th. of September.&nbsp; Of this memorable siege and surrender,
the following account is extracted from Rushworth&rsquo;s
Historical Collections, vol. 5. p. 283, which it is hoped will
not prove unacceptable to the reader.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The town of Lynn Regis (says Rushworth,)
advantageously situated on an arm of the sea, had for a long
while fortified itself, on pretence of <i>neutrality</i>, and for
their own defence; but afterwards shewed themselves <i>wholly for
the king</i>: wherefore the earl of Manchester being made the
parliament&rsquo;s major-general, for the associated counties of
Norfolk, Suffolk, &amp;c. resolved to reduce it; and in order
thereunto, seized the town of <i>Old Lynn</i>, and there planted
ordnance, which much annoyed them in the other town.&nbsp; And
two approaches were made, one by the causeway that leads to the
<i>South</i>, and the other to the <i>East-gate</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
[Against the latter,] &ldquo;The besieged made a brisk sally, and
at once fired two houses in Gauwood, [Gaywood] intending to have
destroyed the whole town, that the enemy might not have quarters
there.&nbsp; But that party were beaten in, and the rest of the
houses preserved.&nbsp; The besiegers summoned in pioneers, from
all the neighbouring parts, and by degrees brought their
approaches within half musket shot: and had begun from a battery
on a hill, near to the end of the town, next the sea, and
resolved upon storming the town, both by land and water, having
provided many boats and ladders for that purpose.&nbsp; But then
received a letter from the town, intimating their willingness to
capitulate: <a name="page757"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
757</span>and so a treaty was agreed on, to be had by eight
persons of a side.&nbsp; Those for the earl of Manchester were,
<i>Sir John Pargrave</i>, <i>Col. Russel</i>, <i>Col. Walton</i>,
<i>Mr. Philip Calthorpe</i>, <i>Mr. John Pickering</i>, <i>Mr.
Gregory Gosset</i>, <i>Mr. John Spilman</i>, and <i>Mr. William
Goodz</i>.&nbsp; For the town <i>Sir Hamon L&rsquo;Estrange</i>,
<i>Sir Richard Hovell</i>, <i>Mr. Clinch</i>, <i>Mr. Dereham</i>,
<i>Mr. Pallet</i> their <i>recorder</i>, <i>Mr. Hudson</i> the
<i>mayor elect</i>, <i>Mr. Leek</i>, and <i>Mr. Kirby</i>:
Between whom, after a long debate, it was agreed to this
effect,&mdash;1. That the town, with the ordnance, arms, and
ammunition be delivered to the earl, and he to enter the
town.&mdash;2. That the gentlemen strangers in the town, shall
have liberty to depart, with every man a horse, sword and
pistols.&mdash;3. That the townsmen shall enjoy all rights and
privileges appertaining to them, with free trading as far as may
consist with law.&mdash;4. All prisoners on both sides to be set
at liberty.&mdash;5. That the desires of the town touching
certain of their ships taken by the parliament frigates, shall be
represented by the earl, to the parliament and the earl of
<i>Warwick</i>.&mdash;6. That neither the persons nor estates, of
any inhabitants or strangers now resident in Lynn, shall be
molested for any thing past, or done by them since the earl of
Manchester&rsquo;s coming into these parts.&mdash;7. That, for
preventing of plundering, the town shall raise and pay <i>ten
shillings a man</i>, to all <i>private soldiers</i> under the
earl&rsquo;s command, and a <i>fortnight&rsquo;s pay</i> to the
<i>officers</i>.&mdash;8. and lastly, That <i>Sir Hamon
L&rsquo;Estrange</i>, <i>Sir Richard Hovell</i>, <i>Capt.
Clinch</i>, <i>Mr. Recorder</i>, <i>Mr. Dereham</i>, and <i>Mr.
Leek</i>, remain as hostages, until the conditions be
performed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page758"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
758</span>&ldquo;The same night, part of the Earl&rsquo;s forces
took possession of the town; and the next morning his lordship
made his entry, and sent 500 men to <i>Hull</i>.&nbsp; Soon after
be withdrew the rest of his forces into Lincolnshire, leaving
Col. <i>Walton</i> governor of Lynn.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here it may be observed, that the forces that besieged and
took Lynn, consisted solely of infantry: the cavalry attached to
this army had remained in Lincolnshire, under the command of
<i>Cromwell</i>, who was now beginning to distinguish himself as
a soldier.&nbsp; But neither he nor his cavalry, were present at
this siege, though some people have thought otherwise, for no
better reason, seemingly, than the idle presumption that Cromwell
must have been concerned in all the notable transactions of that
memorable period.</p>
<p>Among the remarkable occurrences which took place here during
this siege, the following has been found in a certain MS. account
of the town&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On Sunday the 3rd of September, in the
afternoon, and in the middle of the sermon, came a shot of 18lb
weight in at the window over the west door of St.
Margaret&rsquo;s church, and took the middle pillar a great part
off, and broke it in many hundred pieces, dispersing them in all
directions, all over the church.&nbsp; One piece of the stone,
fell into a seat at the lower end of the church, where five men
set, [sat,] and split the board before them, on which they laid
their books; but no harm was done to them.&nbsp; The preacher, a
reverend divine, named <i>Mr. Hinson</i>, left his sermon and
came out of the church, and all the people departed in a most
confused manner; <a name="citation759a"></a><a
href="#footnote759a" class="citation">[759a]</a> <a
name="page759"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 759</span>some
leaving their hatts, some their books, and some their scarves;
but, praised be God, no further hurt was done to any
person.&rdquo; <a name="citation759b"></a><a href="#footnote759b"
class="citation">[759b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Near three months after the surrender of Lynn, the following
order of both houses was issued, bearing date December 9th
1643&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Forasmuch as the Earl of Manchester, in his
articles of agreement with the town of king&rsquo;s Lynn,
remitted the offence in reference to himself and his array while
they lay before the town; but touched upon no private injuries
done by the malignants to the well-affected: it is this day
ordered by the Lords and Commons that such persons as did take
any of the goods of the well-affected, by themselves or such as
they appointed, or did any damage to their houses or mills, or
any other ways, shall make restitution to all such well-affected
persons as have been damnified, according to the greatness of
their losses.&nbsp; And that <i>Col. Walton</i>, governor of
King&rsquo;s Lynn, <i>Mr. Percival</i> and <i>Mr. Toll</i>,
members of the House of Commons, [for that town,] shall examine
what damage hath been done to the well-affected, and appoint such
as have done them injury to make them reparation accordingly: and
if any of them shall refuse to make such reparation, that the
said governor, Mr. Percival, and Mr. Toll, shall <a
name="page760"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 760</span>have power
to sequester so much of the estates of such malignants as will
make the reparation, and assign it to those that have been
damnified.&rdquo; <a name="citation760a"></a><a
href="#footnote760a" class="citation">[760a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence it appears, that the town was then divided into two
great political parties, the most powerful of which approving,
and even admiring the corruptions and insanities of the Court:
how far the case is similar or dissimilar at present, we need not
say.</p>
<p>Sometime after the above order was issued by the two Houses, a
party of royalists, at the head of which was young
<i>L&rsquo;Estrange</i>, afterwards the noted Sir <i>Roger</i>,
formed a plan for surprising the town and recovering it for the
king, who had granted him a commission, constituting him its
governor, in case of success.&nbsp; But the design was betrayed
by two of his confederates, though both bound by an oath of
secrecy: which shews what trusty and choice hands they
were.&nbsp; L&rsquo;Estrange was consequently seized, tried by a
court-martial, and condemned to die as a traitor.&nbsp; The
sentence however was not executed.&nbsp; He remained in prison
from 1644 till 1648, when he luckily escaped, and sometime after
got out of the kingdom, where he remained, as was said before, <a
name="citation760b"></a><a href="#footnote760b"
class="citation">[760b]</a> till the autumn of 1653, when he
succeeded in making his peace with the Protector: after which he
lived in this country unmolested to the day of his death, when he
was at a very advanced age.</p>
<p>About two years after L&rsquo;Estrange&rsquo;s adventure, we
find the following notice taken of this town in a Public <a
name="page761"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 761</span>Paper,
called &ldquo;The Weekly Account,&rdquo; of Wednesday May 6.
1646&mdash;It is an order of Parliament dated April 31. and thus
worded&mdash;&ldquo;Whereas the town of Lynn Regis hath suffered
very much by the <i>Lord Paulet</i>, It is ordered that
reparation should be made to the said town, <i>according to their
Petition</i>, out of his estate.&rdquo;&mdash;The <i>Weekly
account</i> was a quarto news-paper, of one sheet,
&ldquo;containing certain special and remarkable passages from
both Houses of Parliament, and collections of several Letters
from the armies.&rdquo;&mdash;We no where else meet with any
account or intimation of damages sustained by Lynn from <i>Lord
Paulet</i>: but the fact cannot be doubted.&nbsp; The town, it
appears, had complained to Parliament, and <i>petitioned</i> on
the occasion.&nbsp; Could that petition be found, it would, no
doubt, cast some light upon this dark part of our history.</p>
<p>It is very certain that this town was no small sufferer during
that revolutionary period, as appears from the Journal of the
House of Commons in Rushworth&rsquo;s Historical Collections,
Vol. 7. p. 1217, where we find the following
passage&mdash;&ldquo;Saturday, August 5, 1648.&nbsp; The House
was informed that the town of <i>Lynn Regis</i> did want much
repair, being ruined by these times of war.&nbsp; The House
ordered 2000 oaks for reparation thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
conduct of the parliament, or <i>then</i> House of Commons looked
well, as it indicated some regard for <i>justice</i>.&nbsp; We
seldom, if ever, meet with similar instances in the conduct of
the other, or opposite party.&nbsp; It is not very usual with
crowned heads, or <a name="page762"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
762</span>their minions, to think much of making reparation for
injuries, much and devoutly as it is to be wished, that it always
formed a prominent and essential part of their character.</p>
<p>For the remaining years, down to the restoration, this town
appears to have remained tranquil, and pretty loyal to the
constituted authorities, or new order of things.&nbsp; It seems
also to have soon surmounted its former sufferings, <a
name="citation762a"></a><a href="#footnote762a"
class="citation">[762a]</a> and to have fast advanced in wealth
and prosperity.&nbsp; We discover no particular symptoms of
disaffection here within those years, unless it was about 1650,
when there was an insurrection of the royalists in this county,
and a <i>major Saul</i>, a worthy gentleman, as an old MS. says,
was hanged here in the Tuesday market place, for being concerned,
it seems, in that affair.</p>
<p>About the same time, or within the same year, one <i>Dorothy
Floyd</i>, (or <i>Lloyd</i>,) also was hanged here, as the same
old MS. says, for <i>Witchcraft</i>: which we now just mention,
as we had overlooked it before, in our account of those who
unhappily suffered at Lynn for that reputed or imaginary crime.

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Cromwell in much request at Lynn about the
commencement of this period&mdash;the reason of it
conjectured&mdash;his visit here</i>, <i>and that of
Fairfax&mdash;character or quality of the then parliamentary
representatives of the town&mdash;how chosen&mdash;paid by their
constituents&mdash;demur on that score&mdash;payment enforced by
parliament</i>: <i>&amp;c.</i></p>
<p>The reputation and influence of Cromwell appear to have been
very considerable in these parts before the breaking out of the
war.&nbsp; In his native county of Huntingdon, and that of
Cambridge, he was evidently well respected; and especially in the
Isle and Fens and parts adjacent.&nbsp; In the direction and
management of the drainage and other affairs of the Fens his
interest appeared scarcely inferior to that of the earl of
Bedford, if it did not sometimes exceed it.&nbsp; He appears to
have been at the head of the opposition to that nobleman, to
which party this town then belonged, as well as that of
Cambridge, which Cromwell represented in parliament.&nbsp; The
service which he had rendered to his party must have procured him
their good opinion: and this, together with his general
reputation, might be the reason of his being treated here with
uncommon distinction.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1643, and but a few months before the Siege
we find him invited here by the mayor and corporation; and the
following order is still extant in their books&mdash;&ldquo;March
20th. ordered a free entertainment at the town charge, by Thomas
Gurling Esq. mayor, for Col. Cromwell and those gentlemen of his
equipage, according to the invitation of Mr. Mayor, in answer to
a Letter he received from Col. Cromwell.&rdquo;&mdash;In the <a
name="page764"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 764</span>same books,
a few weeks after, was inserted the following
memorandum&mdash;&ldquo;April 17.&nbsp; Mr. Mayor was allowed
5<i>l.</i> for his preparations for the entertainment of Col.
Cromwell.&rdquo; <a name="citation764"></a><a href="#footnote764"
class="citation">[764]</a>&nbsp; This was at an early period of
the war, before the town had ventured to declare for the king,
and when they appeared desirous of keeping fair with the
parliament, or being treated on the footing of neutrality.&nbsp;
But whatever might be its policy, it was a very undignified
conduct, as must always be the case where duplicity or hypocrisy
forms the leading feature.&nbsp; The event shews that a different
conduct would have answered better:&mdash;agreeable to the old
adage or maxim, that &ldquo;Honesty is the best
Policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The burgesses or representatives sent by this town to the
<i>short</i> parliament, which met in the spring of 1640, as well
as those sent to the <i>long</i> parliament, which met the
ensuing autumn or winter, were chosen from among its principal
and responsible inhabitants; which seems to have been strictly
proper and unexceptionable.&mdash;The representatives in the
former or <i>short</i> parliament were <i>Mr. Wm. Doughty</i> and
<i>Mr. Tho. Gurlyn</i>, the two <i>senior aldermen</i>; those in
the latter, or <i>long</i> parliament, were <i>Mr. John
Percival</i> and <i>Mr. Tho. Toll</i>; who were also chosen from
among the aldermen.&nbsp; To each of those representatives their
constituents allowed <i>five shillings a day</i> for their
trouble, while they attended <a name="page765"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 765</span>their duty in parliament.&nbsp; With
this trifling allowance, while it was paid, the recipients appear
to have been quite satisfied.&nbsp; But their constituents soon
grew tired of it, and withheld it from them, which occasioned the
interference of parliament, as appears by the following
order.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;October 15. 1642&mdash;It is this day
ordered by the Commons, now assembled in parliament, that the
mayor, aldermen, and common counsell of the town of King&rsquo;s
Lynn, in the county of Norfolk, shall pay and allow, out of the
town stock, as formerly, unto John Percevall <a
name="citation765a"></a><a href="#footnote765a"
class="citation">[765a]</a> and Tho. Toll, their burgesses for
this present parliament, as large an allowance, per diem, as they
have hitherto <a name="citation765b"></a><a href="#footnote765b"
class="citation">[765b]</a> allowed any of their aldermen that
have been burgesses in parliament for that towne, notwithstanding
the <i>freemen</i> <a name="citation765c"></a><a
href="#footnote765c" class="citation">[765c]</a> of that town
<i>had their voyces</i> in the choice of the said John Percevall
and Tho. Toll to be their burgesses in the present
parliament.&nbsp; If the mayor of Lynn can shew any cause to the
contrary wee shall be ready to hear him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Corporation appear to have been pretty much at a loss how
to act in this affair.&nbsp; No public notice appears <a
name="page766"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 766</span>to have
been taken of it from the middle of October till the beginning of
January.&nbsp; On the 2nd. of that month the Corporation had a
meeting on the occasion, when the above order was taken under
consideration.&nbsp; On the next day they met again, when it was
resolved and ordered that the following Letter or address should
be presented to the House of Commons, by way of answer.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We the Mayor, Aldermen, and Comon Councel,
whose names are hereunto subscribed, doe in all humbleness
represent unto your grave wisdoms, That as heretofore no
parliamentary wages have been paid before the parliament
<i>ended</i>, <a name="citation766"></a><a href="#footnote766"
class="citation">[766]</a> nor then out of the town stock, but by
the <i>Freemen</i> and <i>Inhabitants</i>, saving that of late
time, meerly of bounty not of dutye, the burgesses were diversely
rewarded by the representative body, so in like humbleness we
represent the now impossibility of performance of the said order,
in respect wee have not at present (nor had at any time since
notice of the said order) any Town-Stock at all, nor are likely
to have any for many years to come, for that our revenues are not
sufficient to defray the necessary charges wee annually disburse
for the ordinary maintenance of the town, whereunto wee are tyed,
besides the extraordinary expences which unavoidably do and will
daily fall upon us for the safety of our town in especiall, and
of the kingdom in generall, all which wee humbly refer to your
high Justice and Honorable Consideration.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page767"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 767</span>As
this address was a mere shuffle, it was not likely to impose upon
parliament, or prove ultimately of any avail to the
corporation.&nbsp; They affected however, to be still desirous of
keeping fair with that body; and accordingly treated Cromwell and
his company, when they visited the town, two or three months
after, with marks of most respectful attention. <a
name="citation767"></a><a href="#footnote767"
class="citation">[767]</a>&nbsp; But that was probably a piece of
downright finesse on their part, to gain time and bring the plot
which they were forming, or their plan of future resistance to
greater ripeness and a fairer chance of success.&nbsp; Even their
withholding from their two members the usual allowance for their
attendance in parliament may be naturally supposed to have
resulted from the design of declaring for the king and against
the parliament: and this design was put in execution the ensuing
summer, which brought on the siege and other events already
noticed.</p>
<p>The Corporation evaded the payment of the said daily allowance
to their two members for a whole year or more: but it was not
forgotten by the parliament, who sometime after the siege, appear
to have put them again in mind of it.&nbsp; Accordingly we find
that the following memorandum stands yet in the
corporation-books&mdash;&ldquo;Nov. 24. (1643,) ordered that
<i>five shillings per diem</i> be paid to John Percevall and Tho.
Toll, burgesses in this parliament, from the time they went to
parliament to this day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus the affair ended; and
our representatives, it is presumed, continued to receive the
like <a name="page768"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
768</span>allowance afterwards, till the restoration.&nbsp; But
it does not appear, or is at all likely to have been the case any
longer, as to this town, though it might elsewhere. <a
name="citation768"></a><a href="#footnote768"
class="citation">[768]</a>&nbsp; At the period of which we are
speaking, it was, probably, pretty general.&nbsp; Had it been
universal, and so continued to this day, it would, no doubt, have
been a very happy circumstance for these kingdoms.&nbsp; Our
House of Commons, in that case, would have felt more for the
country than it has generally done in these latter times: not to
say that the people too had been then more careful in the choice
of their representatives.</p>
<p>As to the two last <i>elections</i>, already glanced at, that
for the <i>short</i> and that for the succeeding <i>long</i>
parliament, they appear to have differed from each other in this,
that the former was the act or deed of the <i>corporation
alone</i>, and the latter that of the <i>whole body of
freemen</i>, as is the case (at least <i>nominally</i>) at
present.&nbsp; Succeeding elections seem to have exhibited
similar diversity.&nbsp; In Cromwell&rsquo;s <i>first</i>
parliament, that of 1653, it does not appear that Lynn had any
representatives.&nbsp; It is therefore likely that there was here
then no previous election.&nbsp; In the <i>second</i> protectoral
parliament, which met in 1654, this town was represented as
usual; but how the election was conducted does not seem very
clear, though it appears most probable that the freemen at large
had no share in it, as may perhaps be concluded from the
following memorandum in the town-books&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;1654 July 21.&nbsp; Ordered that 4<i>l.</i>
15<i>s.</i> expended by <a name="page769"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 769</span>Mr. Mayor on the day of the election
of the burgesses to serve in parliament <i>for this
corporation</i> be paid by the chamberlain.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That the election for the members sent to the 3rd protectoral
parliament (that of 1656,) was managed by the corporation
<i>solely</i> seems pretty evident from the following note in the
town books&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;1656.&nbsp; August 18th.&nbsp; This day
general John Desborow and major general Philip Skippon are chosen
<i>in this house</i> to serve as burgesses for this borough in
his Highness next parliament upon the 17th September next,
according to a precept directed to Mr Mayor from the Sherife, and
ordered that <i>their charges be paid by this
House</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the election of the members who represented Lynn in the
protector <i>Richard&rsquo;s</i> parliament the
<i>corporation</i> appear to have exercised the same arbitrary
power as before, of being <i>sole electors</i>.&nbsp; Several of
the other freemen at the same time desired permission to poll,
but were not allowed.&nbsp; At the election which took place in
April 1660 the freemen again applied for permission to vote
which, after some hesitation, was acceded to, and the members
were then chosen by the <i>general body</i> of free burgesses. <a
name="citation769"></a><a href="#footnote769"
class="citation">[769]</a></p>
<p><a name="page770"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 770</span>Thus
we see how things formerly stood in this town, as to the state of
political liberty, or the freedom of election.&nbsp; Former times
appear not to have been very <a name="page771"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 771</span>pure in those respects, any more
than the present.&nbsp; In looking to our ancestors for much
political rectitude or public virtue, we are often most sadly
disappointed.&nbsp; It is now frequently made a subject of
complaint or reflection, that our present members are chosen, in
fact, by two or three individuals; but the same seems to have
been almost always the case ever since the reformation, and
revolution, as well as before.&nbsp; The freemen at large are
indeed <i>said</i> to have a <i>voice</i> in the election of our
members; but it is all a joke, while freedom of acting, or voting
without constraint or control is totally out of the
question.&nbsp; It is well known at what risk most of our
pretended <i>freemen</i> would vote freely at our elections, <a
name="page772"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 772</span>and how
much it has cost some of them before now for presuming so to
do.&nbsp; All this however must be very wrong, if our
constitution ought to be in practice what is it in theory.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> III.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Maintenance of the clergy&mdash;state of
the public morals and manners&mdash;mode and progress of
reformation at Lynn</i>, <i>under the Common-wealth and
Protectorate</i>.</p>
<p>Of the Lynn clergy during this period Dr. <i>Arrowsmith</i>
and Mr. <i>Horn</i> appear to have been by much the most
eminent.&nbsp; The former we think was one of the ministers of
St. Margaret&rsquo;s parish.&nbsp; That his character, as a
divine, stood very high, appears from his being appointed one of
the Assembly of Divines, which was convened in 1643, and which
appointment put an end probably to his residence here.&nbsp; He
became afterwards Master of Peter-House in Cambridge.&nbsp; Mr.
Horn must have settled here after the departure of Dr.
Arrowsmith; not as his successor, however; for he was the
minister of <i>South Lynn</i>, and held that situation till after
the restoration, when we find him among those <i>two thousand</i>
worthies, commonly called the &ldquo;Ejected
Ministers.&rdquo;&nbsp; As minister of Alhallows or South Lynn,
he laid his income at 80<i>l.</i> a year, a sum equal to 5 or
600<i>l.</i> at <a name="page773"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
773</span>least, of our money.&nbsp; This comfortable situation
and ample income he gave up, to preserve a good conscience; an
instance and a proof of integrity which must endear his memory to
all honest and good men.</p>
<p>The clergy of St. Margaret&rsquo;s parish had probably as good
an income as their brother of Alhallows, but the exact amount of
theirs we have not the means of ascertaining.&nbsp; But in the
town-books there is the following memorandum dated December 18.
1637 &ldquo;Lionell Gatford minister to have 50<i>l.</i> yearly
and a dwelling house, provided he agree not to meddle in the
election of church wardens or parish clark.&rdquo;&mdash;This
50<i>l.</i> was equal to 3 or 400 of our pounds, so that the
liberality of the corporation to their minister at that period
must have far exceeded what we understand it to be at
present.&nbsp; As the said 50<i>l.</i> was over and above, or
exclusive of the vicarial dues, and what we call surplice fees,
the minister&rsquo;s income must have been what may be called
very decent and handsome at the period of which we are now
treating.</p>
<p>After this town had been reduced under the dominion of the
parliament it soon began to put on a religious and puritanical
appearance.&nbsp; The publicans and those who frequented their
houses were now obliged to be very particularly upon their guard,
and at their peril to observe a decency of behaviour.&nbsp; Those
who were guilty of <i>tippling</i> were fined, as were also the
<i>occupiers</i> of the public houses where those offences were
committed.&nbsp; <i>Profane swearing</i> was also punished in
like manner, as well as <a name="page774"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 774</span><i>loitering</i> in the time of
divine service on the Lord&rsquo;s day. <a
name="citation774a"></a><a href="#footnote774a"
class="citation">[774a]</a>&nbsp; A strict attention to these
matters began to be paid by the magistrates very shortly after
the reduction of the town; and they appear to have pursued the
same course pretty regularly thenceforward till the
restoration.&nbsp; The town accordingly, soon assumed a decorous
and respectable appearance.&nbsp; It was no longer disgraced as
before by drunkenness, riot, or profane swearing.&nbsp; In fact,
it was in a manner regenerated; and might with a good deal of
propriety be denominated a <i>christian town</i>.&nbsp; The
<i>Lord&rsquo;s Day</i> was observed with remarkable decorum and
solemnity; and on the <i>Thursdays</i>, in <i>lecture time</i>,
the <i>shops</i> were kept <i>shut up</i>, to the end the people
and their servants might the better attend the hearing the word
of God. <a name="citation774b"></a><a href="#footnote774b"
class="citation">[774b]</a>&nbsp; On the whole, this town appears
to have been for the greatest part of this period as well
governed as at any one time either before or afterwards.</p>
<p><a name="page775"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 775</span>The
love of <i>tippling</i> appears to have been then in Lynn one of
the greatest obstacles to the reformation of the people.&nbsp;
The town was full of petty pot-houses, a great many of which were
private and unlicensed.&nbsp; Even as late as 1657 we find no
less than 40 or 50 of these private and unlawful places of resort
heavily fined by the magistrates.&nbsp; This was, at the time,
complained of, as a grievous oppression, and is so still
represented in some of the existing MS. accounts of that period;
which shews how unwilling the people were to forsake their
immoralities, tho&rsquo; their rulers obliged them to do so
outwardly.&nbsp; The restoration followed soon after, and we need
not wonder that the profaneness and profligacy, then introduced
and <i>restored</i>, proved highly acceptable and pleasing to the
majority of the Lynn people, who now found themselves pretty well
freed from most of the former troublesome checks upon immorality
and licentiousness.</p>
<p>Of the persevering exertions of our magistrates, during this
period, to check the prevailing propensity of the lower orders to
tippling, profane swearing, and the like irregularities, many
instances occur in our old records.&nbsp; Of several of those
instances, in 1644, some notice has been taken already.&nbsp;
Others are recorded as having occurred in 1645, <a
name="citation775"></a><a href="#footnote775"
class="citation">[775]</a> but a far greater number in the
following <a name="page776"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
776</span>year, (1646,) <a name="citation776"></a><a
href="#footnote776" class="citation">[776]</a> which seems to
indicate the uncommon zeal and vigilance of the then chief
magistrate, or chief magistrates, for they seem to have occurred
<a name="page777"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 777</span>partly
in the mayoralty of <i>Edward Robinson</i>, and partly (but
chiefly) in that of <i>Thomas Toll</i>, one of the members for
the town, who appears to have stood high here then in the public
estimation.</p>
<p>In some of the succeeding years the attention of our
magistrates appears to have been no less engaged in these
corrective measures.&nbsp; 1651 was one of those years.&nbsp;
<i>Bartholemew Wormell</i> was then mayor; at least for the first
nine months of it; and he seems to have trod pretty much in the
steps of his brother <i>Toll</i>.&nbsp; The offences that came
under his cognisance seem to have exceeded in number rather than
fallen short of those committed during the mayoralty of the
latter.&nbsp; They were of various sorts; such as
<i>swearing</i>, <i>tippling</i>, <i>excessive drinking</i>,
<i>keeping unlicensed alehouses</i>, <i>travelling on the
Lord&rsquo;s day</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>&nbsp; By the distance
between one and another of the years of remarkable delinquency
and coercion, it would seem that the irregularities were checked
for a time, but would afterwards break out afresh, with
increasing force, like water pent up, or impeded in its course by
a dam.&nbsp; At the distance of five or six years the vigorous
interference of the magistrates appears always to have become
necessary.&nbsp; 1645, 1651, and 1657, were the most remarkable
years for the interposition of the municipal power to correct the
existing abuses.</p>
<p><a name="page778"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 778</span>The
last of those years (1657) was exceedingly remarkable for the
number of petty pot-houses, or private drinking places then
discovered in the town.&nbsp; They amounted seemingly to <i>near
fifty</i>, for such a number of persons appear to have been then
fined, &ldquo;for selling beer without licence.&rdquo;&nbsp; Vice
seems to have then skulked into those places of private resort,
and no longer cared to shew its face in public.&nbsp; Most of our
misdoings appear to have been then confined to those petty and
private pot-houses, and but one misdeed occurs within that year
which would seem to have been committed elsewhere; and the same
is recorded in these words&mdash;&ldquo;Received of Mr. James
Davey, which he levied upon an offender for prophaneing the
Lord&rsquo;s day, 10<i>s.</i>&rdquo;&mdash;In short, one cannot
help concluding that the town was then, in point of outward
decency, much superior to what it is in the present day.&nbsp; We
are not quite sure that there were then any <i>common
breweries</i> here: and if there were, it is not probable that
they were the <i>property of magistrates</i>.</p>
<p>Nor did the improvement which then took place in the town
consist merely in the outward deportment or appearance of the
inhabitants, but it seems to have also extended to the temper and
disposition of a great many of them; as appears from the numerous
acts of humanity and deeds of charity which are found to have
been then promoted and performed here, beyond any preceding or
subsequent period that we know of.&nbsp; The sufferings and
distresses of their fellow creatures, far and near, at home and
abroad, were then viewed, or listened to, at Lynn <a
name="page779"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 779</span>with
sympathetic and commiserating attention, as is evinced by the
numerous collections which then took place here for the relief of
such sufferers and objects of distress and misery.&nbsp; The
statement below in reference <i>chiefly</i> to the years 1653 and
1654, will give the reader some idea of the good character of our
ancestors at the time of which we are treating. <a
name="citation779"></a><a href="#footnote779"
class="citation">[779]</a>&mdash;In short, we know <a
name="page780"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 780</span>not of any
period when Lynn abounded more than it did then, in acts of
charity and humanity, in works of mercy and fruits of
righteousness; or when it made, on the whole, a more
christian-like appearance: notwithstanding the immoral
propensities of many of the inhabitants, and the adherence of not
a few of the rest to superstitious or fanatical delusions.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> IV.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Miscellaneous remarks</i>, <i>or a cursory
view of divers other matters relating to this town</i>,
<i>within</i>, <i>or about the same period</i>.</p>
<p>Nothing, perhaps, exhibits more strikingly the wide difference
between that time and the present, than the then defective state
of <i>postage</i>, or letter-carriage, between this town and
London.&nbsp; Had any one then foretold that we should ever have
a mail-coach or mail-cart, or any other conveyance to bring
letters from London, or carry them thither <i>daily</i>, it would
have passed as an idle tale, no more credible or probable than
bishop Wilkins&rsquo; notion or supposition of the probability of
future intercourse between our world and the moon.&nbsp; The
former fact, <a name="page781"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
781</span>however, has been realized.&nbsp; But at the period of
which we are speaking Letters used to arrive here from London or
were conveyed thither from this town <i>once a week</i>, and that
by a foot messenger.</p>
<p>Accordingly we have the following article, or memorandum in
the corporation books, No. 8. under the year 1638,
9&mdash;&ldquo;Feb. 11th. Richard Harrison and Richard Smith are
chosen to be two <i>foot posts</i> for this town of Lynn to
London interchangeably by turns every week, and to have
30<i>s.</i> each, from the town, per annum.&rdquo;&nbsp; From the
then mode of carrying on trade one may easily conceive that the
intercourse between the two places was very small, and the
letters conveyed to and fro very few, compared to what is the
case at present.&nbsp; But the wages or salary of these postmen
is not a little remarkable:&mdash;<i>sixty shillings</i> a year
for going afoot every week to London!&nbsp; Neither the
generosity nor even the justice of the town seems to shine
here.&nbsp; Who would undertake such a service now for <i>sixty
guineas</i> a year?&nbsp; Yet we are not sure that the
<i>shilling</i> of that time was altogether as valuable as our
<i>guinea</i>.&nbsp; It must however have been pretty nearly so:
and within our own memory, even in this best of reigns, the
<i>guinea&rsquo;s value</i> has been reduced to <i>seven
shillings</i>, if not lower.&nbsp; But on this subject we need
not to enlarge.</p>
<p>In 1642 a measure was adopted, in the <i>Hall</i>, which must
needs be creditable to the memory of its then members.&nbsp; The
affair is thus expressed in the corporation books, under that
year, or rather in the <i>book of Extracts</i> <a
name="page782"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 782</span>before
mentioned&mdash;&ldquo;October 9th.&nbsp; Ordered that the
<i>Charters</i> shall be read by the town-clerk, <i>in
English</i>, that <i>those of this House</i> may the <i>better
understand what they are sworn to maintain</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
seems very reasonable and very right, and indicates something
like an earnest wish in the body corporate to avoid
<i>perjury</i>, and to act conscientiously and honorably in their
official capacities, or as municipal functionaries.&nbsp; How
expedient it might be <i>at this present time</i> to have a
motion made in the Hall to the same effect, or to have a similar
measure adopted there, it is not for us to determine.&nbsp; But
we cannot help suspecting that some, if not the majority of our
present corporate body are to the full as ignorant of the
contents of their charters, and of what they are <i>sworn to
maintain</i>, as ever their predecessors were, who adapted the
measure, or passed the order in question.</p>
<p>Our body corporate at the period of which we are treating, and
long after, entertained very different ideas on some points from
those of their successors of the present day: and that difference
was not, perhaps, more remarkable on any point than on the course
to be taken with such of their own members, or brethren, who
<i>ceased to be residents</i> in the town, or became
<i>absentees</i>.&nbsp; Formerly the <i>non-residence</i> of
members was on no account allowed, or connived at.&nbsp;
<i>Aldermen</i>, <i>common-council-men</i>, and even the
<i>recorder</i>, as well as town-clerk and chamberlain, were
required to be all residents: and whenever they ceased to be so,
or happened to become absentees, they were always forthwith
discharged, or cut off, as rotten and useless members.&nbsp; The
necessity <a name="page783"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
783</span>of this our corporation used formerly to insist upon,
as what a due regard for the good government and prosperity of
the town, as well as the very nature of their respective oaths
and offices rendered indispensible.&nbsp; In short, it seemed to
be their unanimous and invariable opinion that the nonresidence
of any one of their fraternity was insufferable, and inconsistent
with both honour and honesty, and of course with the character of
a <i>gentleman</i>.</p>
<p>Their successors of the present time view the subject in
another and a very different light.&nbsp; Our absentees are now
very numerous, and seem to be daily on the increase.&nbsp; They
consist already of several <i>aldermen</i> and <i>common council
men</i>, with the <i>recorder</i> himself at their head&mdash;<a
name="citation783"></a><a href="#footnote783"
class="citation">[783]</a> all <i>honourable men</i>, no doubt:
though we cannot help suspecting that their predecessors, of
other times, would have bestowed upon them another and a somewhat
more degrading appellation, and especially upon <i>the rest of
the brotherhood</i> who quietly suffer their nonresidence, or
allow them to retain their membership <a name="page784"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 784</span>while they remain absentees.&nbsp;
It is now a common complaint, that, owing to these absentees, the
corporation business is much obstructed, so that it is often very
difficult, and sometimes impossible to get what is called <i>a
Hall</i>: yet no one, it seems, has the honesty, or the courage
to move for the expulsion of those worse than useless members, as
would always have been the case heretofore.&nbsp; This obvious
symptom of declension and depravity in this corporation, may
serve, perhaps, to illustrate what is said to be also actually
the case on our great national theatre, or throughout the
empire.</p>
<p>How these matters, or this case, stood formerly will appear
from the following samples, out of the corporation
books&mdash;&ldquo;February 17th (1644, 5)&nbsp; This day it is
agreed by order of this House, that Gregory Turnall, late one of
the common-councell here, by reason of his <i>absenting
himself</i> from the Hall (tho&rsquo; he hath often been
required) be <i>discharged</i> our
society.&rdquo;&mdash;again&mdash;&ldquo;1647, February.
14.&nbsp; This day it is agreed upon, that for that Mr. Richard
Davy, late one of the common-councel of this House, is now gone
to live at Yarmouth, therefore this House doe discharge him of
the same place.&rdquo;&nbsp; again&mdash;&ldquo;March 16th.
1659.&nbsp; Nathaniel Atwood <i>discharged</i> from the office of
a common-councell-man, having long <i>absented himselfe</i>, and
being <i>employed in the
navy</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;again&mdash;&ldquo;1661, October 25.&nbsp;
Forasmuch as Mr. William Keeling, <i>one of the aldermen</i> of
this burgh, hath a long time <i>absented himselfe</i> from this
burgh, and from attending the service as alderman of this burgh,
although he hath been thereto often requested, and is <a
name="page785"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 785</span>now at
present absent out of the town, whereby the service of this burgh
is very much impeded, to the great damage of the said burgh; it
is thereupon this day ordered, that the said Wm. Keeling be
<i>discharged</i> from being an alderman of this
burgh.&rdquo;&mdash;again&mdash;&ldquo;November 28. 1673.&nbsp;
This day Mr. Giles Alden (by reason of his being very much
<i>absent</i> from this society, whereby the business of this
corporation is much impeded and neglected) is by the mayor and
aldermen <i>discharged</i> from being one of the common-councell
of this burgh.&rdquo;&mdash;again,&mdash;&ldquo;September 29.
1728.&nbsp; Ordered that Robert Britiffe Esq. <i>Recorder</i> of
this burgh, be <i>discharged</i> of his attendance as Recorder,
for his neglect of duty and
<i>nonresidence</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;These extracts plainly shew
what was the practice of our corporation formerly, in regard to
such of their members as happened to become nonresidents or
absentees, and how very different that practice was from that
which prevails at present.&nbsp; The reader is now left to judge
which is the most proper or reasonable, the former or the present
practice.</p>
<p>At the period we are now reviewing, a roasted <i>swan</i>
seems to have been in great request at our Lynn entertainments:
hence we read under the date of Sept. 24.
1649&mdash;&ldquo;Granted to John Bird, a lease for seven years
of three ferry rights, at 10<i>l.</i> per annum, and a brace of
swans well fatted to the mayor.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the ferryman,
probably, found it difficult sometimes to get, or to fatten those
large birds; in which case the mayor might be expected to
condescend to accept of an equivalent.&nbsp; Something <a
name="page786"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 786</span>like this
accordingly occurs under the date of March 15. 1657,
&ldquo;Ordered that the chamberlain pay to the mayor for the time
being 40<i>s.</i> on the 1st of January yearly, in liew of a
brace of fatted Swanns usually delivered to the mayor by the
person who hired the Ferry rights.&rdquo;&mdash;The taste of our
countrymen has undergone a great change since; and the Swan no
longer appears upon our tables.</p>

</a></p>
<p>At the beginning of this period there were here no more than
<i>six corn-meters</i>, but on the 14th.&nbsp; November 1653 they
were increased to <i>ten</i>, which seems to indicate our trade,
and particularly the corn trade, as well as the agriculture of
the country to have been then in a state of
progression.&mdash;The town seems also to have had then a greater
intercourse with the country on its <i>eastern</i> than on its
<i>southern</i> side; which we may infer from the following
article in the corporation books, dated April 4. 1653:
&ldquo;Ordered that Henry Bloye, the <i>Southgate</i> porter,
shall have the Tolls of that Gate at 1<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> a
year; and James Browne, the porter at the <i>East-gate</i>, shall
pay for the Tolls of that Gate 1<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> a year,
during the pleasure of this House.&rdquo;&mdash;The East gate is
supposed still to retain a similar superiority.&mdash;It is
somewhat remarkable that in those days the town-clerks of Lynn,
as well as the recorders, were regular barristers: accordingly we
find it noted in the corporation records, &ldquo;December 6.
1652&mdash;This day Thomas Ulber Esq. councellor at Law is chosen
Town-clerk, in the room of John Williamson Esq. councellor at
Law, discharged.&rdquo;&mdash;Our corporation must have been then
<a name="page787"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 787</span>well
furnished with legal knowledge.&nbsp; In later times all our
town-clerks were below the degree of barristers. <a
name="citation787"></a><a href="#footnote787"
class="citation">[787]</a></p>
<p>On the 3rd of July 1657 the tolls of the East and South Gates,
(as appears from the town-books,) were let for 15<i>l.</i> a
year, which seems to shew that they were now much more productive
than in 1653, when they were let for only 3<i>l.</i> a
year.&nbsp; It is very natural to infer from this, that the trade
of the town, or its intercourse with the country had much
increased during those years.&mdash;On the 18th of July in the
next year, (1658, as we learn from the same source) St.
James&rsquo; church yard was ordered to be a burying place for
the parish of St. Margaret&rsquo;s, <i>for one year</i>,
&ldquo;there not being <i>room</i> in St. Margaret&rsquo;s
church-yard:&rdquo;&mdash;but it seems rather unaccountable how
making St. James&rsquo; church yard the parish burying-place for
<i>one year</i> could materially alter the case as to the want of
room in St. Margaret&rsquo;s church-yard, or furnish more room
there for burying at the end of that term than there was at the
beginning of it.&nbsp; It might however be here suggested by way
of query, if it would not have been quite as well, on a recent
occasion, and far better in point of expense, to have made use
again of St. James&rsquo; church <a name="page788"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 788</span>yard (including the south side)
instead of forming the new burying ground?&mdash;at least, till
the times proved more favourable; which, it is to be hoped, will
be the case in the next reign, if not sooner.</p>
<p>The period we are now reviewing, and the review of which we
are now about to conclude, was perhaps the most remarkable of any
in the history of this town, as well as that of England and of
Britain.&nbsp; Nor does it seem to have been more remarkable for
any thing than for the exertions then made to reform the morals
and manners of the great mass of the people.&nbsp; But those
exertions were generally too rough and violent, and therefore
more calculated to make hypocrites than sincere converts, as must
always be the case when such works are carried on by coercive
means, rather than by rational persuasion, or upon right
christian principles.&nbsp; Accordingly our reforming
magistrates, by way of reclaiming their townsmen from their
tippling propensities, and bringing them from drunkenness to
sobriety, had recourse to <i>fines and imprisonment</i>, which as
was before observed, fell sometimes very heavy upon the
publicans, no less than <i>six and thirty</i> of whom were
imprisoned in the course of one year, as we learn from one of our
old MS. accounts.&nbsp; These measures excited a violent
prejudice against our reformers, and against the reformation
itself.&nbsp; Fining was called <i>plundering</i>, and
imprisonment, passed for persecution and tyranny.&nbsp; But the
restoration brought things back into the old channel, and
relieved our publicans and tipplers from these hardships.</p>

789</span>CHAP. V.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">History of Lynn from the Restoration to the
Revolution.</p>
<p>Between the period which we have been last reviewing and that
which we are now entering upon there was confessedly a very wide
and glaring dissimilarity: no two periods could well exhibit a
more obvious and striking contrast.&nbsp; The spirit of
puritanism predominated in the former, and that of libertinism,
or, in other words, of licentiousness and profligacy in the
latter.&nbsp; The rulers of the nation, in the former period,
were men of sobriety and gravity, in the latter they were
dissipated and dissolute.&nbsp; The former appeared to have for
their aim the amendment or improvement of the national manners
and morals, the latter the very reverse, for they were actually
the promoters and patrons of all manner of depravity, of every
thing that was vile, profligate, or flagitious.&nbsp; The two
brothers, Charles and James, and their ministers, were certainly
some of the <a name="page790"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
790</span>vilest wretches that providence ever sent to punish and
plague and curse a sinful nation.</p>
<p>As to Cromwell, it is pretty much the fashion to decry and
vilify him, as a dissembling villain, a base hypocritical knave
and usurper: but no one need to envy the discernment,
penetration, or sagacity of those men who cannot perceive that
his moral character was not below that of either the first or
second Charles, and that his character as a statesman, and his
talents for government, were infinitely superior to those of
either of them, or of any of their kindred.&nbsp; No proof has
ever been produced that he was a greater dissembler, or a more
unprincipled wretch than those two princes; and it might perhaps
without much difficulty be shewn, that, <i>in comparison with
either of them</i>, he was really an honest, virtuous, great and
good man.&mdash;As to what is deemed his greatest crime, that of
compassing the king&rsquo;s death, the great law of
self-preservation will certainly plead much in extenuation of
that act; for it is now very well known that Cromwell was
previously in possession of good and absolute proof that it was
the king&rsquo;s intention to sacrifice him, in case he could
bring the treaty then on foot between him and the parliament to a
successful termination.&nbsp; The intercepted Letter to the queen
convinced Oliver that he had no chance for his life, if the king
reascended the throne.&nbsp; He therefore resolved to prevent
that, and save his own life by sacrificing that of the king. <a
name="citation790"></a><a href="#footnote790"
class="citation">[790]</a>&nbsp; This was very natural, and few
men would have done otherwise.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Cursory remarks on the
Restoration&mdash;its memorable effects&mdash;great joy
manifested here on the occasion&mdash;several remarkable
rejoicings at Lynn in the course of this period</i>.</p>
<p>The Restoration was one of those revolutionary events which
occur in the history of this country.&nbsp; It was effected, says
one of our historians, &ldquo;without any effusion of
blood.&rdquo;&nbsp; But what is more to be wondered at, is, that
whereas so much blood had been spilt to compel <i>Charles I.</i>
to come to terms with his people, towards which it is certain he
at last made large concessions, <i>Charles II.</i> should be
received without any conditions at all.&nbsp; Upon this bishop
Burnet, in the <i>History of his own times</i>, observes, that
<i>Hale</i>, afterwards lord chief justice, did move that a
Committee might be appointed to look into the propositions that
had been made, and the concessions that had been offered by the
late king, and from thence digest such propositions as they
should think fit to be sent over to the king.&nbsp; As such a
motion was foreseen, <i>Monk</i> was instructed how to answer [or
overrule] it.&nbsp; He accordingly told the House, that he had
information of such numbers of incendiaries still in the kingdom,
that if any delay was put to the sending for the king, he could
not answer for the peace either of the nation or army: and as the
king was to bring neither army nor treasure with him, either to
fright or corrupt them, propositions might be as well offered to
him when he should come over; so moved for sending commissioners
immediately.&nbsp; This was echoed with such a shout all over the
House, that <a name="page792"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
792</span><i>Hale&rsquo;s</i> motion was no more insisted
on.&nbsp; To the King&rsquo;s coming without conditions, says the
bishop, may well be imputed all the errors of his reign. <a
name="citation792a"></a><a href="#footnote792a"
class="citation">[792a]</a>&nbsp; To allow him so to return and
ascend the throne was certainly a flagrant proof of the folly and
pusillanimity of the convention parliament, and of the baseness
of that spirit which then predominated among out ancestors.</p>
<p>Such a tide of extravagant joy overspread the nation upon the
king&rsquo;s arrival, as in the end very much hurt and debased
the morals of the people, and introduced an almost universal
dissoluteness of manners, which was encouraged and propagated by
the ill example of the king and the court.&nbsp; From the
enthusiasm and fanaticism, which prevailed in the former period,
the nation fell now into the opposite extreme of licentiousness
and immorality; one or the other of which extremes being always
the consequence of men&rsquo;s not governing themselves by
reason. <a name="citation792b"></a><a href="#footnote792b"
class="citation">[792b]</a>&nbsp; Thus the country had no great
cause to congratulate itself on the blessed effects of the
restoration of royalty, or the revival of the old order of
things.&nbsp; No nation in Europe could be more depraved and
licentious than the English in the reign of Charles the
second.</p>
<p>Much pains were taken, before his majesty&rsquo;s arrival, to
represent his character in the most favourable and respectable
light.&nbsp; Though the first born of profligacy and
scoundrelism, he was reported, by his faithful and thorough-paced
agents, as the very mirror of wisdom, of virtue, and of
piety.&nbsp; These reports were not more <a
name="page793"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
793</span>industriously or artfully circulated than they were
readily and generally believed, so that we need not wonder if the
country in general looked upon the arrival of Charles as the
commencement of the golden age, or of the reign of a heaven-born
prince.&nbsp; Such seems to have been actually the case.&nbsp;
The confidence the people had in the king, says Kimber, from the
extraordinary good opinion they had been prepossessed with in his
favour, and their transports of joy at being delivered from the
late confusions and distractions, by means of his restoration,
will account for the excessive complaisance that was shewn to the
court at the beginning of this great event, so that the
parliament could scarce deny the king any thing.&nbsp; To the ill
use made of this confidence is to be imputed the opposition which
the court met with afterwards.</p>
<p>Our ecclesiastical historian <i>Neal</i>, speaking of the
restoration, says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here was an end of those distracted times
which our historians have loaded with all the infamy and reproach
that the wit of man could invent.&nbsp; The puritan ministers
have been decried, as ignorant mechanicks, canting preachers,
enemies to learning, and no better than public robbers.&nbsp; The
universities were said to be reduced to a meer Munster, and that
if the <i>Goths</i> and <i>Vandals</i>, and even the
<i>Turks</i>, had overrun the nation they could not have done
more to introduce barbarism, disloyalty, and ignorance.&nbsp; Yet
in these times, and by the men who then filled the university
chairs, were educated the most learned divines <a
name="page794"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 794</span>and
eloquent preachers, such as the <i>Stillingfleets</i>,
<i>Tillotsons</i>, <i>Bulls</i>, <i>Barrows</i>, <i>Whitbys</i>,
and others, who retained a high veneration for their learned
tutors after they were ejected and displaced.&nbsp; The religious
part of the common people have been stigmatized with the
character of <i>hypocrites</i>, their looks, their dress and
behaviour, have been represented in the most odious colours; and
yet one may venture to challenge these declaimers to produce any
period of time since the reformation, wherein there was less open
profaneness and impiety, and more of the spirit as well as the
appearance of religion.&nbsp; Perhaps there was too much rigour
and preciseness in indifferent matters; but the lusts of men were
laid under a visible restraint; and though the legal constitution
was unhappily broken, and men were governed by false politicks,
yet better laws were never made against vice, or more rigorously
executed.&nbsp; The dress and conversation of people was sober
and virtuous, and their manner of living remarkably frugal.&nbsp;
There was hardly a single bankruptcy to be heard of in a year,
and in such a case the bankrupt had a mark of infamy upon him
that he could never wipe off.&nbsp; Drunkenness fornication,
profane swearing, and every kind of debauchery, were justly
deemed infamous, and universally discountenanced.&nbsp; The
clergy were laborious to excess in preaching and praying, and
catechising youth and visiting their parishes.&nbsp; The
magistrates did their duty in suppressing all kinds of games,
stage-plays, and abuses in publick-houses.&nbsp; There was not a
play acted on any theatre in England for almost twenty
years.&nbsp; The Lord&rsquo;s day was observed with unusual
reverence; <a name="page795"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
795</span>and there were a set of as learned and pious youths
training up in the university as had ever been known.&nbsp; So
that if such a reformation of manners had been obtained under a
legal administration they would have deserved the character of
the best of times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when the legal constitution was restored, there
returned with it a torrent of debauchery and wickedness.&nbsp;
The times which followed the restoration were the reverse of
those that preceded it; for the laws which had been enacted
against vice for the last twenty years being declared null, and
the magistrates changed, men set no bounds to their
licentiousness.&nbsp; A proclamation indeed was published against
those loose and riotous cavaliers, whose loyalty consisted in
drinking health and railing at those who would not revel with
them: but in reality the king was at the head of these disorders,
being devoted to his pleasures, and having given himself up to an
avowed course of lewdness; his bishops and chaplains said, that
he usually came from his mistresses apartments to church, even on
sacrament days.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet he was, on earth, the supreme head of the church, and that
church the best constituted in the world.&nbsp; It must need,
surely, be well, extremely well constituted (and so must any
body) not to be contaminated, disordered, or distracted with, or
by such a head.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nothing was to be seen at court but
feasting, hard drinking, revelling, and amorous intrigues, which
engendered the most enormous vices.&nbsp; From court the
contagion spread like wild fire among the people, in so <a
name="page796"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 796</span>much that
men threw off the very profession of virtue and piety, under
colour of drinking the king&rsquo;s health: all kinds of <i>old
cavalier rioting</i> and debauchery revived; the appearances of
religion which remained with some, furnished matters of ridicule
to libertines and scoffers.&nbsp; Some, who had been concerned in
the former changes, thought they could not redeem their credit
better than by deriding all religion, and telling or making
stories to render their former party ridiculous.&nbsp; To appear
serious, or make conscience either of words or actions, was the
way to be accounted a schismatick, a fanatick, or a sectarian;
though if there was any real religion during the course of this
reign, it was chiefly among those people.&nbsp; They who did not
applaud the new ceremonies were marked out for
<i>presbyterians</i>, and every presbyterian was a
<i>rebel</i>.&nbsp; The old clergy who had been sequestered for
scandal, having taken possession of their livings, were
intoxicated with their new felicity, and threw off all the
restraints of <i>their order</i>.&mdash;Such was the general
dissoluteness of manners that attended the deluge of joy which
overflowed the nation upon his majesties restoration.&rdquo; <a
name="citation796a"></a><a href="#footnote796a"
class="citation">[796a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to Lynn, at and subsequently to the restoration, it appears
to have largely shared the general joy and other effects produced
by that memorable event.&nbsp; When we consider the extreme
rigour of the former government or governors of this town, <a
name="citation796b"></a><a href="#footnote796b"
class="citation">[796b]</a> in attempting fines and <a
name="page797"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
797</span>imprisonment to restrain the tippling and other vicious
and licentious propensities of the inhabitants, we cannot much
wonder at the excessive joy which the restoration excited here,
as it was very natural to expect that that event would
effectually remove those severities, and introduce a more lax and
indulgent system.&nbsp; How long the first transports of joy
lasted we are not able exactly to ascertain; but that they were
at their height on the first royal birth day, the 29th of May
1660, we may very reasonably presume.&nbsp; On that day the town
was all festivity and triumph.&nbsp; Among the curiosities that
graced that memorable carnival were 300 young maids, or lasses of
the town, dressed all in white, and parading through the
principal streets. <a name="citation797"></a><a
href="#footnote797" class="citation">[797]</a>&nbsp; Whether this
may, or may not be considered as an emblem of the predilection of
the sex for Charles, or that of Charles for the sex, we will not
take upon us to say.&nbsp; That it was a whimsical contrivance
seems very evident; and that it was peculiar to this town appears
more than probable, as we do not recollect having heard of any
thing like it elsewhere on that day, or on that occasion.</p>
<p><a name="page798"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 798</span>This
was certainly one of the most gladsome seasons that Lynn ever
witnessed: but it was not the only season of that description
that occurred here during the period now under review.&nbsp;
There are others of the same kind that ought here not to pass
unnoticed.&nbsp; One of these was in the spring of 1680, on
account of the arrival of the duke of York from Scotland, and the
discomfiture of the <i>Whigs</i> or petitioners, (or the
king&rsquo;s rejection of the petitions of the people for the
assembling of parliament,) and, of course, the success and
triumph of the <i>Tories</i> or court party, then called
<i>Abhorrers</i>, as they professed to abhor such petitioning,
and approve of the king&rsquo;s governing without
parliaments.&nbsp; On these interesting accounts there was much
rejoicing at Lynn; and</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;on the 30th of April that year, the
following Address was read in the Hall, and signed the same day
by every one of that House: and the mayor, (Giles Bridgeman) was
desired to commend the same to the hands of the right honorable
the Earl of Yarmouth (Lord Lieutenant of the County) to be
presented by him to his Majesties.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;To the King&rsquo;s most
excellent Majestie,</p>
<p>Dread Sir,&mdash;Wee your Majesties Dutifull and Loyall
Subjects, the Mayor, Recorder, Aldermen, and Common-Councell of

</blockquote>
<p>In this remarkable and curious Address to the Throne, what
choice matter of joy, thankfulness, congratulation, and triumph
is exhibited on the part of the Addressers!&nbsp; The King
appeared resolved to govern despotically, or without a
parliament.&nbsp; Many of his subjects had petitioned and prayed
him to call or assemble a parliament.&nbsp; He had rejected those
petitions and prayers with disdain.&nbsp; The Lynn Corporation
address him on the occasion, congratulating, praising and
extolling him to the skies for acting the despot and turning a
deaf ear to the prayers and supplications of <a
name="page800"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 800</span>his
aggrieved subjects.&nbsp; For such royal doings, and for the
arrival and presence of the Duke of York at court, which presence
had always been a curse to the nation, the corporation of Lynn
congratulated their profligate sovereign, and offered to stand by
him at all events.&nbsp; Moreover, they exhibit, all the while, a
most sanctimonious appearance, and profess <i>with all their
souls to bless Almighty God</i> for what was one of the greatest
curses of their oppressed country.&mdash;So much for this royal
and notable Address from Lynn. <a name="citation800"></a><a
href="#footnote800" class="citation">[800]</a></p>
<p><a name="page801"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 801</span>As to
the accession of James to the throne, it appears to have been
contemplated at Lynn with no small pleasure and satisfaction, and
the day on which that memorable event was announced here to have
been a day of uncommon rejoicing.&nbsp; We accordingly find the
following note in the Town Books, &ldquo;Febr. 10th. (1685) King
James II. proclaimed with all due solemnities and signalls of Joy
and Gladness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Four days after was &ldquo;ordered an
<i>Address</i> to the King&rsquo;s Majestie.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
having never seen a copy of this Address the present writer
cannot give a particular account of its contents.&nbsp; He cannot
however doubt but it was in the usual style of Lynn Addresses to
that monarch.</p>
<p>Another season of extraordinary festivity and exultation at
Lynn occurred in 1686.&nbsp; It was on no less interesting an
occasion than the erecting of the statue of the sovereign in the
Tuesday Market place.&nbsp; We accordingly read, in
<i>Mackerell&rsquo;s</i> &ldquo;Chronological Account&rdquo; of
the town, of &ldquo;great rejoicings here that year, at the
setting up of the statue of king James II.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
majesty (as well as king John) seems to have been long the object
of the admiration of the Lynn people.&nbsp; They admired him
while Duke of York, and after his accession to the throne they
never rested till they had set up his image or statue in the most
public and conspicuous part of their town.&nbsp; Of this royal
and memorable affair Mackerell has given the following
information in another part of his work&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>An account of
</i><span class="smcap"><i>King James</i></span><i> IId&rsquo;s

802</span>&ldquo;On the 13th day of <i>April</i> 1686. which was
the anniversary of their majesties coronation, the same was kept
with all due solemnity; the mayor, aldermen, and the rest of the
body, meeting in their formalities in the <i>Guild-Hall</i>,
after Divine Service at the church, proceeded from thence
attended with musick, to the great Market-place; in the middle
whereof, by the Gentlemen and other Loyal Inhabitants of the
corporation, was then erected the Effigies of his Sacred Majesty
upon a Pedestal, with several carvings and embellishments,
inclosed with a Pallisade of Iron, under inscribed,</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Non Immemor</i><br />
<i>Quantum Divinis Invictiss. Principis</i><br />

<p>In English</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Not forgetting how much is due to the
<i>Divine Virtues</i> of the <i>Victorious</i> King <span
class="smcap">James</span> <i>the Second</i>, the Senate and
People of Lynn, as a <i>lasting Monument</i> of their

<p><a name="page803"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

discharging the Great Guns, with all other Demonstrations of Joy
and Loyalty.&rdquo; <a name="citation803"></a><a
href="#footnote803" class="citation">[803]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such is Mackerell&rsquo;s account of the extraordinary
festivities and rejoicings at Lynn on this great and important
occasion.&nbsp; It was, no doubt, worth recording, and it may
still be worth preserving here, if it were only for this special
reason, that it may help to give us just ideas of the general
character of corporations, and of their proceedings.&nbsp; Here
is a <i>Statue</i> erected to one of the vilest of human beings;
and here are <i>virtues</i>, and even <i>Divine Virtues</i>!
ascribed to one who was as devoid of every thing of that kind as
the very devil: and here is an <i>Inscription</i> denominating
the erection of the Statue a <i>Lasting Monument</i> of
<i>Faith</i> and <i>Loyalty</i>; and yet this boasted
<i>faith</i> and <i>loyalty</i>, and <i>lasting Monument</i>,
lasted only about <i>three</i> or <i>four</i> years.&nbsp; The
Statue was pulled down mutilated, decollated, disfigured,
dismembered, and buried in dirt and rubbish, where it remains to
this day.</p>
<p>There was here also a remarkable exhibition of joy and
gratitude, as well as loyalty, in 1687, excited, it seems, by his
majesty&rsquo;s royal and memorable Declaration, and the
consciousness of its being the duty of every member of the Church
of England to defend and support him with their <i>lives</i> and
<i>fortunes</i>.&mdash;The following Address to the Throne was
accordingly agreed <a name="page804"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
804</span>upon and ordered to be sealed with the common Seal,
September 19. 1687.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Great
Sir</span>,&mdash;The known principles of the Church of England
being such as oblige every member thereof with their Lives and
Fortunes to defend and maintain your Majestie Your Royall
Prerogative with all other rights belonging to your Majesties
Imperiall Crown, makes us at this time humbly to begg your
Majesty to receive this further attestation, not in the least
doubting of the peaceable enjoyment of our religion under Your
Majesties most sacred protection, returning our most hearty and
humble thanks for Your Majesties late repeated Assurance thereof,
expressed in Your Majesties late gracious Declaration.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such was the Address which was sent at that time from
Lynn.&nbsp; But his sacred majesty soon found that the boasted
principles of the Church of England were not sufficient to secure
to him the attachment of his subjects and the quiet possessions
of his throne, unless he relinquished those favourite projects of
his which appeared hostile to that church.&nbsp; For the very
next year a very alarming defection took place, and the majority
of those of that communion became inimical to his
government.&nbsp; Even the <i>Life and fortune men</i> forsook
him, and beheld his downfal without concern or
commiseration.&nbsp; So false did that description of his
subjects prove to him, and so unavailing also in the end did he
find even the great orthodox doctrine of <i>passive obedience</i>
and <i>nonresistance</i>, which had been the favourite doctrine
of the Church of England during the whole of his brother&rsquo;s
reign.</p>
<p><a name="page805"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 805</span>A few
months after the last mentioned affair took place in January
1688, a fresh occasion of rejoicing was presented to the Lynn
people.&nbsp; This was the annunication of the queen&rsquo;s
pregnancy; which proved not a little satisfactory and gratifying
to our corporation, as appears from the following note in their
books:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;January 26.&nbsp; Ordered and agreed that
Sunday the 29th Instant being appointed by his Majestie a day of
Thanksgiving for her Majesties being happily with child, the
several members of this House doe attend Mr. Mayor (Robert
Sparrow Esq.) in their formalitys at morning and evening service,
to render thanksgiving to Almighty God for so signall a blessing,
and after evening service to repair to the Custom House to drink
the king&rsquo;s health with a Bonefire.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the 2nd. of the following July, the Gentlemen and good
people of Lynn were furnished with matter of still higher
gratification, by the knowledge of her majesty&rsquo;s safe
delivery, and the birth of a <i>prince</i> <a
name="citation805"></a><a href="#footnote805"
class="citation">[805]</a> who would be likely to inherit his
royal sire&rsquo;s faith, piety, sapience, and sublime
virtues.&nbsp; This important intelligence, as might be expected,
was very joyfully received, and occasioned the immediate
assembling of the corporation.&nbsp; In that assembly, or
meeting, was proposed and voted an Address to his Majesty, of
which the following is a copy:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Great
Sir</span>&mdash;Wee Your Majesties Dutifull Subjects crave leave
of Your Majesty and your Royall <a name="page806"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 806</span>Consort that we join with Your
Majestie in offering our most humble and hearty thanks to God
Almighty in sending Your Majestie a Sonn and a Prince, and
farther we begg of your Sacred Majestie to accept our Cordial
thanks for your Majesties late favor to the body of this
Corporation, <a name="citation806"></a><a href="#footnote806"
class="citation">[806]</a> and also for your Princely
condescension and affection by both your gracious Declarations,
not only extending to the Church of England but to all other your
peaceable and loyall Subjects, Assuring us by Your royall word
you will stand by us, whereby we are not only obliged but
resolved, when your Majestie shall think fitt to call a
Parliament, wee will endeavour to elect such members as shall
make your Majesty happie and Your Subjects easie, and shall pray
for Your Majestie&rsquo;s long and peaceable reigne over
us.&nbsp; In witness whereof we have fixed our Town Seale the 2nd
of July in the 4th year of your most gracious reign, Anno Domini
1688.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, it is presumed that we are fully warranted to
affirm, that Lynn has never been more attached to any of our
sovereigns than to King <i>John</i> and King <i>James</i> the
second; and that even his present majesty, with all his shining
virtues, is not more, if so much beloved here as those two
monarchs were.&nbsp; It may perhaps be difficult to account for
it, yet it seems unquestionably to be the fact, that of all the
princes that ever <a name="page807"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
807</span>swayed the British Sceptre, none ever shared more
largely in the affection admiration, and veneration of the good
people of this town than those three potentates.&nbsp; Nor have
there been any other reigns under which our townsmen seemed more
ready to congratulate themselves on the superior happiness they
enjoyed, or the transcendent benefits and blessings they derived
from the throne.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> II.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Brief account of divers other remarkable
circumstances relating to Lynn during this same
period&mdash;decay of trade&mdash;increase of poor&mdash;Anmer
coal</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>
<p>After Charles&rsquo; restoration, or accession to the throne,
it was not to be expected that he should remain long unaddressed
by this town.&nbsp; Accordingly we find that within the very
first month of his actual reign, (June 16. 1660,) a
congratulatory Address to him was voted and ordered in the Hall;
and moreover, &ldquo;that the Fee farm rents formerly paid from
this town to the Crown, and lately purchased by the mayor and
burgesses, amounting to 41<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> be
restored to his majestie.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having never seen this
Address, or any copy of it, we can give no particular account of
its contents; but we need not to doubt but it teemed with
servility, or was in no small degree of a fawning, crouching or
cringing cast.&nbsp; As to the <i>Feefarm rents</i> which
belonged to the <a name="page808"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
808</span>Crown, but had been lately purchased by the Mayor and
burgesses, and were now restored to his majesty, they appear to
require no comment, or farther elucidation in this place.&nbsp;
The restoring of them to his majesty was a matter not of choice
but of necessity: and in purchasing them the Corporation
evidently <i>gained a loss</i>; but to what amount we cannot say,
having never learnt how much was paid for them.</p>
<p>A week after, (on the 23rd of the same month,) our Corporation
agreed and ordered, that <i>Oliver&rsquo;s Charter</i> confirming
the priviledges [of the town] be <i>cancelled</i>.&nbsp; This
also appears to have been a matter of absolute necessity; but
whether so or not, that charter would be of no further use to the
body corporate.&nbsp; Oliver&rsquo;s day was now past, and
whatever had sprung from him, if it did not actually disgrace the
character of the holder or owner, yet was no longer held in any
manner of estimation.&nbsp; That there is a copy now extant of
this Charter of his we have not learnt.</p>
<p>Soon after the restoration this town began to suffer
considerably from the decay of trade and consequent increase of
the poor, which did not seem very well to accord with the
excessive rejoicings that had then taken place.&nbsp; Within two
years after that event those effects had made so alarming a
progress, and the complaints of the sufferers had become so loud,
that the body corporate found it necessary to take the affair
into their immediate and most serious consideration, in order to
check as much as possible the growing evil, and alleviate <a
name="page809"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 809</span>in some
degree the sufferings of the poor inhabitants.&nbsp; The truth of
this statement, and the mode of proceeding adopted then in the
Hall in order to relieve or mitigate the distresses of the poor
will appear by the following extract from the Corporation
books.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;May 12. 1662.&nbsp; Forasmuch as the Poor
of this Burgh thro&rsquo; <i>great losses</i> and <i>decay of
trade</i> are grown very numerous, and the charge of them greater
than can be well born by the inhabitants, and a great part of the
coal trade carried on by Strangers and Foreigners, which bring
their coals hither to sell in Ships and Vessells belonging to
other Ports, who tho&rsquo; they reap a profit bear not the least
part of the burthen, to the great discouragement of the
Navigation belonging to this town and the impoverishing of the
inhabitants thereof, It is thereupon [at the earnest request of
the most considerable freemen Burgesses and Inhabitants of this
town] this day ordered that every freeman or burgess of this
burgh that shall from henceforth buy or cause to be bought of any
stranger or foreign person not being free of this burgh any coals
called Newcastle, Sunderland or Sea-water being lading or freight
in any Ship or Vessell belonging to any such Stranger or outward
Port whether the same be to sell again or for there (their) own
expense shall pay for every chalder of coals so bought as
aforesaid to the use of the mayor and burgesses of this burgh and
their successors the sum of 12<i>d.</i> to be employed for and
towards the necessary reliefe and maintenance of the poor of the
said borough, the <a name="page810"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
810</span>same to be levyed of every such freeman or burgess so
buying the same as aforesaid by distress and sale of their Goods,
or by such other ways and means as shall be thought most fitt and
meete&mdash;And it is further ordered that no burgess or
inhabitant of this burgh shall take any such coals out of any
such strangers&rsquo; Ship or Vessel with intent to sell the same
again untill the end of three working days next after the
arrivall of such Strangers&rsquo; Ship within this Port, to the
end the inhabitants of this town may be served with coales in
that time for their own firing, according to severall former
orders made to that purpose, and publication of this order to be
made by the bellman.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How long this law remained in force, or this impost continued
to be paid does not appear; but it is not very likely that it
ceased, or was discontinued till the arrival of better times, and
the removal of those evils which led to its adoption.&nbsp;
<i>Fourpence</i> a chalder, if we are not mistaken, is still
charged on the coals brought by strangers, and applied in like
manner to the relief of the poor.&nbsp; Why should it be no more,
when thrice as much was charged so long ago? and a shilling then
was worth a great deal more of our money.&nbsp; Surely the
present pressure of the poor rates, which so large a proportion
of the householders so severely feel, would justify the adoption
of such a measure now, if it be allowable.</p>
<p>Towards the close of the year when the above transaction took
place this town was visited by Lord Townshend, Sir John Tracy,
Sir Edward Walpole, John <a name="page811"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 811</span>Spelman and Roger Spelman Esqrs. as
commissioners under a late act of parliament for the
well-governing and regulating of Corporations.&nbsp; This act
seems to have sprung from the narrow and arbitrary policy of the
Stuart princes, who aimed at having corporations as much as
possible under their direction and management, or subject to
their immediate and absolute power and control.&nbsp; These
commissioners were entertained here at the expense of the mayor
and burgesses.&nbsp; They were, it seems, invested with large
powers, so as to be authorized to displace any they happened to
dislike of our municipal functionaries, and put others whom they
thought better of in their room.&nbsp; In this town they expelled
<i>alderman</i> Robert Thorogood and appointed one Lawrence
Withers in his stead.&nbsp; A few weeks before &ldquo;Mr. Fr.
Rolfe was discharged from his office and place of Town-clerk, and
Mr. Owen Barnes was elected in his room.&rdquo;&mdash;This is
said to have been done by the <i>mayor and aldermen</i>; but it
is probable that the Commissioners were privy to it, and that it
was a step taken in compliance with an intimation from them, for
the time of their visit had been previously fixed.&nbsp; Those
appear to have been the only changes which then took place in the
Hall.</p>
<p>Under 1663 a circumstance has been recorded which casts some
light on the ideas or sentiments which the Lynn people then
entertained of their parliamentary representatives; and though
they no longer allowed them daily wages, as formerly, yet they
evidently considered the honest and diligent discharge of their
trust or service <a name="page812"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
812</span>as entitled to more than mere thanks.&nbsp; Had they on
the other hand failed in the performance of their delegated
functions, their constituents undoubtedly would have deemed that
failure censurable.&mdash;The circumstance alluded to is
explained in the following extract from the Hall books:
&ldquo;June 13. 1663, It is this day ordered that the
Chamberlaine remitt to London 40<i>l.</i> to buy two pieces of
Plate, of the value of 20<i>1.</i> each, to be presented as a
gratuity from this House to Sir Edward Walpole and Sir William
Howell (Hovell) <a name="citation812"></a><a href="#footnote812"
class="citation">[812]</a> burgesses in parliament for this
burgh, for their faithfull services in behalf of this
burgh.&rdquo;&nbsp; What were those services in behalf of this
burgh, which are here glanced at, and were deemed so meritorious,
we are not told; but it is very clear that these representatives
had acquitted themselves entirely to the satisfaction of their
constituents.&nbsp; It is much to be wished that the same could
be said of all our present national representatives.</p>
<p>Under the same year an occurrence is mentioned in one of our
MSS, which leaves a foul stain on the memory of our ancestors of
that period, and shews how much they were then the slaves of
bigotry and intolerance.&nbsp; This was the persecution and
imprisonment of several members of that pacific and respectable
sect called <i>Quakers</i>, which seems to have been the only
description of <a name="page813"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
813</span>sectaries, except the <i>Presbyterians</i>, that had
then attempted to introduce themselves into this town.&nbsp; But
they were bitterly opposed here, as they were then also
throughout the nation; and their sufferings were very great and
grievous during almost the whole reign of <i>Charles</i> and
<i>James</i> the second, to the lasting disgrace of a pretended
christian and protestant government.&nbsp; It is to
<i>William</i> and the <i>Revolution</i> that we owe, under
providence, the adoption of a wiser policy and the enjoyment of
better times.</p>
<p>In 1664 the high price of coals was severely felt here.&nbsp;
That commodity advanced that year from 17<i>s.</i> a chalder to
30<i>s.</i> and upwards.&nbsp; This seems to have been owing to
the late impost of 1<i>s.</i> a chalder laid by the Corporation
on all coals brought by <i>strangers</i>, who consequently
discontinued their visits.&nbsp; It seems rather probable that
that impost or tax was now abolished, for we are told that the
coal afterward, <i>by reason of strangers&rsquo; resort</i>, came
again to the old price.&nbsp; It may therefore be concluded that
the Lynn ships alone were not sufficient at that time to supply
the town and all the inland country with that article.&nbsp; The
same would probably be still the case, if this port was not
frequented by any coal ships but such as belonged to the
town.&nbsp; We are therefore, probably, much more indebted to
strangers for our plentiful supplies of fuel than we are apt to
imagine.</p>
<p>In 1665 Lynn was visited by that grievous scourge the Plague,
which made great ravages here.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wardsmen were
appointed, one at the East and the other at <a
name="page814"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 814</span>the
South-gate to keep out all Mackerell Carts from coming into the
town:&rdquo; the communication with the county was cut off; no
Mart was kept that year, and the very markets were for sometime
discontinued.&mdash;In the Summer of the very next year, 1666,
which was a hundred and forty five years ago, a cart, (as is
recorded in one of our manuscripts,) came hither from
<i>Anmer</i>, loaded with <i>coals</i>, which were <i>here sold
by the mett</i> or <i>bushell</i>.&nbsp; It seems therefore that
there is coal somewhere about Anmer; but to what extent we cannot
pretend to say.&nbsp; Nor does it appear what search or trial was
there made for it, or why the attempt was given up.&nbsp; A good
Coal-mine in that part of the country would, no doubt, be very
desirable.</p>
<p>We know of no very remarkable event that occurred here
afterward till 1670, when the town was honoured with a visit from
the <i>duke of Richmond and Lenox</i>, of which the following
notices are extracted from the Hall books&mdash;&ldquo;July
23.&nbsp; It is this day ordered that his Grace the Duke of
Richmond and Lenox upon his request shall have his Freedome of
this Burgh gratis: and hereupon his Grace the said duke of
Richmond and Lenox did this day come into this House and did take
the Oathes of Aledgiance and of a Free Burgess; Mr. Thomas Greene
and Mr. Benjamin Holly being his
Suretyes.&rdquo;&mdash;again&mdash;&ldquo;July 28th.&nbsp;
Ordered that the Chamberlain pay Mr. Mayor&rsquo;s bill of
Disbursements for the entertainment of the duke of Richmond and
lord Townshend, 21<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> and 13<i>s.</i>
4<i>d.</i> for his Cook, and for a hogshead of French Wine sent
aboard the duke&rsquo;s Vessell.&rdquo;&mdash;<a
name="page815"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 815</span>Hence it
appears that the duke came and departed by water.&nbsp; But the
Sum of 22<i>l.</i> would go then much further than it would at
present.&nbsp; It would go now but a very little way in
entertaining brace of peers, with their retinue, and purchasing a
hogshead of French wine.</p>
<p>Towards the latter part of this year the Corporation was
presented with a plan or map of their town, as appears from the
following note in the Hall-books&mdash;&ldquo;October 14. 1670,
This day alderman Edmund Abbott brought into this House a
Topographical Draught of the town of King&rsquo;s Lynn, which was
given to the town by Sir Algernoon Payton; and Henry Bell Esq.
mayor, is desired to peruse the said draught, to be mended and
put into a Frame, for the use of the mayor and
burgesses.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same, we presume, was done
accordingly; but we are not quite sure that this draught is still
in existence: if it be, a sight of it might help towards forming
a pretty just idea of the then state or lineaments of the
place.&nbsp; The principal Streets and Lanes, however, must have
been then much in the same situation as at present.&nbsp; In
other respects the town must be now very widely different from
what it was then.</p>
<p>In the same year we find Lynn to be in a great measure a
<i>manufacturing</i> town, especially in the <i>worstead</i>
line, and to have many hands employed in that branch; as appears
from the following note in the Hall-books.&nbsp; &ldquo;December
2. 1670, The worstead weavers petition to procure an Act of
Parliament for the liberty of a Dyer <a name="page816"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 816</span>and Callender to live in the town
for the better [or the benefit of the] trade.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those
weavers must have been pretty numerous, and their trade hopeful
and promising, to warrant or justify such an application.&nbsp;
Still it must seem rather odd that they should think the
obtaining of their object required the aid of an act of
parliament.&nbsp; It does not appear, however, that an
application was actually made to the legislature on this
occasion.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> III.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Account of the king&rsquo;s intended visit
to Lynn</i>, <i>in</i> 1671, <i>with divers other occurrences
relating to this town</i>, <i>in that and some of the subsequent
years</i>.</p>
<p>The king, who used frequently to visit Newmarket, where he had
it royal Lodge or Palace, purposed in the autumn of 1671 to make
an excursion into Norfolk, and to visit Lynn in the course of his
tour.&nbsp; This appears from the following Note from the
Hall-books&mdash;&ldquo;1671, August 11.&nbsp; Ordered that
100<i>l.</i> be paid into the Chamberlain&rsquo;s hands for
defraying disbursements on account of his Majesties
entertainment, who Sir Robert Stewart writes intends to visit
Lynn next month, in his progress.&rdquo;&mdash;Great preparations
were accordingly made by our Corporation for the reception and
entertainment of their sovereign.&nbsp; But it so happened that
our good townsmen were disappointed at last, for his majesty <a
name="page817"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 817</span>never came;
so that the great expense they had been at, in preparing for his
reception was, in a manner, all thrown away.</p>
<p>It is not said what it was that prevented his majesty&rsquo;s
coming, or frustrated his royal intention of visiting his Lynn
subjects at that time.&nbsp; But it seems most probable that the
very foul weather which happened in that month, and the terrible
inundation which then overwhelmed the country about Lynn, were
the principal, if not the sole causes of the relinquishment of
his purpose.&nbsp; The tide rose so high on the 17th. of
September, as we learn from one of our MSS. that the country
about Lynn was all under water, &ldquo;the haycocks swam about
the fields to the first house in Gaywood, and several boats were
rowed from the East Gate to that Village, many Ships were lost,
Marshland was all overflowed, great numbers of sheep perished,
and an immense loss sustained.&rdquo;&nbsp; In short, it seems to
have been here such another disastrous flood as that which lately
devastated the Lincolnshire Coast.&nbsp; The roads must, in many
places, have been broken up, so that the approaches to the town
must have been rendered difficult, if not impracticable.&nbsp; On
the whole, therefore, we cannot wonder that this royal visit was
given up.&nbsp; As to the whole of the provisions and dainties
that had been prepared for the intended august visitor, it does
not appear how it was disposed of at last; but as to what had
been procured from the Metropolis, its final disposal is plainly
enough suggested by the following Note from the Hall
books:&mdash;<a name="page818"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
818</span>&ldquo;November 10, 1671.&nbsp; Ordered that the mayor
have the whole banquet lately sent from London, he paying tenn
pounds.&rdquo;&mdash;So much for this intended royal feast at
Lynn.</p>
<p>In the same year, we find Lord Townshend tampering with the
Corporation, with a view to the introduction of one of his
friends to be chosen one of the Lynn representatives in
parliament: hence we find it thus noted in the Hall
books&mdash;&ldquo;1671.&nbsp; August 7.&nbsp; Whereas Lord
Townshend hath by his Letters to this House recommended Sir
Francis North knight, his Majesties Sollicitor General, as a
person of great worth and honor, and upon all occasions fitt to
be usefull to this burgh in their most important concernments: It
is therefore this day ordered, that the said Sir Francis North
Knight, shall have his freedom of this Burgh gratis.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He soon after became, as had been previously projected, one of
our parliamentary delegates.</p>
<p>Early in 1672 an order was issued from the Hall, which shews
that the occupiers of houses in the Tuesday Market-place were not
then allowed to let their shops during the Mart, unless they paid
rent for the same to the mayor and burgesses.&nbsp; The following
note in the Hall books will serve to elucidate this
circumstance&mdash;&ldquo;January 19.&nbsp; Whereas severall
persons (who have usually lett their shops in the Tuesday
market-place during the time of the Mart, and have therefor paid
a rent for the same to the mayor and burgesses) have of late
refused to pay the accustomed rent, it is this day ordered <a
name="page819"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 819</span>that the
chamberlains doe demand the arrears, and in case of refusal to
cause blinds or bootes to be built up against the
Shops.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such appears to have been the case formerly;
but this claim, we apprehend, is no longer made.&nbsp; We have
not learnt, however, how it came to be relinquished.</p>
<p>In July 1675 Mr. <i>John Turner</i> was admitted or chosen
into the Hall, as common-council-man.&nbsp; Of him it is said
that &ldquo;he was chosen common-council-man, alderman, new-elect
mayor, parliament-man, and captain of the trainbands, all in the
course of two years.&rdquo;&nbsp; From him sprung the family of
that name which afterwards bore great sway in this town for a
whole century.&nbsp; It is no disparagement to this family that
it arose from a low origin; for where is that great family that
has not so arisen?&nbsp; The noble, the royal, and the imperial
not excepted.&nbsp; Many of whom are known to have sprung from
and owed their rise to desperate Adventurers, captains of bands
of robbers and ruffians, men, or rather demons, who defiled
themselves with the foulest deeds, and made their way to power
and greatness in defiance of all laws human and divine.&nbsp; To
the founder of the Turner family no infamy has been
imputed.&nbsp; Report has said that he was originally a waiter at
an Inn at Cambridge, which cannot justly be considered as any
disgrace to his descendants.</p>
<p>In 1676, according to one of the MSS. were first erected the
new buildings, in Broad Street, designed for an Almshouse for
twelve poor men, &ldquo;at the cost and <a
name="page820"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 820</span>charge of
one John <i>Heathcote</i> of Lynn.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mackerell calls
this person <i>Helcote</i>.&nbsp; Whatever his right name was, it
is now almost forgotten, while that of <i>Framingham</i> is in
everybody&rsquo;s mouth: and yet the poor men owe, perhaps, as
much to the memory of the former as they do to that of the
latter, who has engrossed all the praise and credit of this
charity.&nbsp; For had not this Helcote or Heathcote erected
these buildings it is very doubtful if Framingham, rich as he
was, had ever thought of endowing an almshouse.&nbsp; He was a
man of low birth, <a name="citation820"></a><a
href="#footnote820" class="citation">[820]</a> and became
afterwards rich and ostentatious.&nbsp; The death of the founder
gave him an opportunity to become the endower of this almshouse,
and transmit his name to posterity, which he took care to ensure
by having his Will publickly read, and a commemorative Sermon
preached annually.&nbsp; Upon the whole, it is highly probable
that vanity and ostentation had a larger share than charity, or
pure benevolence, in the endowment of these Almshouses.&nbsp;
That, however, cannot lessen the comfort or enjoyment of the poor
men there admitted.&nbsp; The endowment does them as much good as
if it had sprung from the worthiest motive, or most virtuous
principle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the 29th of August, 1677, Ben. Holly Esq. one of the
aldermen, was fined 40<i>l.</i> for refusing to accept of the
mayoralty, being thereunto chosen.&rdquo;&nbsp; The reason of
this refusal is not mentioned; but the alderman was not poorer,
probably, at the end of the year than he <a
name="page821"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 821</span>would have
been had he accepted the office.&mdash;About the close of the
same year, (or early, in the next, as we reckon,) a step was here
taken, the result of which the present writer has often wished to
ascertain, but without success.&nbsp; The step or circumstance
alluded to is thus expressed in the volume of extracts from the
Hall books so often referred to in this
work&mdash;&ldquo;February 4th.&rdquo; (1677, 8) &ldquo;Ordered
that a Letter be wrott to Th. Goddard, Son to Guybon Goddard Esq.
late Recorder of this Burgh, to confer his Father&rsquo;s labours
about the antiquities and antient priviledges of this
Corporation, and that he have a gratuity of
21<i>l.</i>&rdquo;&nbsp; This shews that Mr. Guybon Goddard had
collected materials for a history of Lynn: the same has been also
affirmed by his brother-in-law, Sir William Dugdale, in some part
of his works; so that the fact is beyond all doubt.&nbsp; But the
question is, what became of those materials?&nbsp; If our
Corporation obtained them, they seem to have been lost long
ago.&nbsp; No one now in the Hall, it seems, not even the
town-clerk himself, knows any thing about them.&nbsp; It is
probable Mr. Th: Goddard did not choose to part with them.&nbsp;
What became of them after his time, or whether they are now in
existence or not, there is perhaps very little chance of
discovering.&nbsp; Had they fallen in the present writer&rsquo;s
way, there can be no doubt, from the known character of Guybon
Goddard, but he would have found them of considerable use in this
undertaking.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1678 a pretty strong antipathy to popery
appears to have been prevalent in this town, and measures were
adopted to secure the inhabitants from <a
name="page822"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 822</span>such
dangers as might arise from that quarter.&nbsp; Accordingly we
learn from the Hall books, that it was ordered on the 11th of
November that year, to have &ldquo;a watch kept every night to
prevent dangers from Popish Recusants.&rdquo;&nbsp; This seems to
indicate that the Corporation and people of Lynn were now
inclined to side with the patriots or Whigs against the Court;
which appears somewhat corroborated by their resolving sometime
after to elect two of their own townsmen, in preference to court
candidates, to represent them in the ensuing parliament; as is
evinced by the following document from the Hall
books&mdash;&ldquo;January 29th (1678, 9.)&nbsp; This day upon
reading in this House a Letter from Robert Wright Esq. late one
of the burgesses in parliament for this town, intimating his
desire of being again elected here, it is ordered that thanks be
returned for services received, and to acquaint him that this
House taking notice of the generall averseness of this
corporation to choose any other than an inhabitant of this town,
and two of the Society having declared themselves to stand, this
House cannot with any assurance incourage his coming down for
that purpose.&nbsp; But that they doe and shall retain a true
sense and opinion of his former performances.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
candidates they now returned were Messrs. Turner and Taylor,
afterwards Sir John Turner and Sir Simon Taylor.&nbsp; How
patriotically they discharged their respective duties we are
unable to say.</p>
<p>On the 28th of the following April, 1679, an occurrence took
place here which is well worth recording.&nbsp; It did so much
credit to the moral feelings of one of the <a
name="page823"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 823</span>then
members of the Hall, and does so little to those of certain
members of it in more recent times, (namely, the
<i>absentees</i>, or <i>nonresidents</i> above noticed,) that it
ought by no means to be here passed over in silence.&nbsp; The
person first alluded to was one of the <i>aldermen</i>, and he
was also a <i>physician</i>.&nbsp; He perceived, upon serious
reflection, that the duties attached to the office of an alderman
were incompatible with those that belonged to the exercise of the
medical profession; and as he was not disposed to relinquish the
latter, he felt himself bound in <i>conscience</i> to withdraw
from the Hall and resign his municipal function.&nbsp; This
occurrence is thus noticed in the volume of Extracts from the
Hall or Town Books&mdash;&ldquo;April 18th. 1678, William Bassett
having sent a Letter insinuating the inconsistence of his place
in this House with his Profession of a Physician, and how that he
is necessarily compelled to be criminal in the one whilst he
endeavours to discharge his duty in the other, begs most heartily
to be discharged,&mdash;[this House] doe consent that he be
discharged, &amp;c.&rdquo;&mdash;This singular transaction gives
us a very favourable idea of the character of this alderman, or
<i>doctor Bassett</i>: it certainly deserves to be remembered;
and it is now earnestly recommended to the serious consideration
of the present members of the Hall, and especially the
<i>absentees</i>, whose nonresidence must be more incompatible
with their municipal duties than that gentleman&rsquo;s medical
profession was with his.&nbsp; If there be really any municipal
factions or duties, that are any way useful or interesting to the
community, attached to the appointment <a
name="page824"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 824</span>of
common-council-man, or alderman of Lynn, the due discharge of
them, without all doubt, must be utterly incompatible with the
absence or nonresidence of such functionaries.&mdash;These hints,
it is hoped will not fail to have their due weight with those
individuals to whom they are applicable.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> IV.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Danger incurred by the corporation on
account of the issuing of farthings&mdash;third part of the duty
levied on coals brought by strangers and landed in South
Lynn</i>, <i>allowed to the South-Lynnians&mdash;difference and
great lawsuit between them and the corporation about the
Long-Bridge&mdash;the consequence</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>
<p>Towards the close of 1670 our corporation appeared in no small
fear of danger from their gracious sovereign&rsquo;s displeasure,
on account of their having issued farthings, which was deemed an
encroachment on the royal prerogative.&nbsp; They accordingly
took measures forthwith towards appeasing the Monarch&rsquo;s
wrath and obtaining his forgiveness.&nbsp; This memorable affair
is thus stated in the Town books,&mdash;&ldquo;November 4th 1670,
Forasmuch as Mr. Mayor, (Henry Bell Esq.) did this day present to
this House two Letters, the one from Mr. Recorder, the other from
Mr. Wright, for and about the danger the Town is lyable too, (to)
for and concerning their putting out of Farthings, Mr. Mayor is
desired to answer the said Letters and let them know this House
doe <a name="page825"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
825</span>desire that they would both effectually take care to
use all means to prevent the Quo-ranto (Quo warranto) issuing out
against the Town, and to petition his Majesties pardon, and to
doe whatsoever else they shall judge necessary to prevent any
trouble that may fall on the corporation for the putting out of
these farthings which are out on the corporation
account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The recorder therefore and the other gentleman, (who was also
another great lawyer and one of the members for the town) appear
to have exerted themselves faithfully and successfully on this
occasion.&nbsp; We accordingly find that his sacred
majesty&rsquo;s pardon was actually obtained; but it seems to
have taken up a long time, no less than two years, to effect
this.&nbsp; It may be supposed to have cost a large sum of money,
and we may presume that our corporation did not deem that money
ill spent, though it might far exceed all the profits they had
derived from their coinage.&nbsp; Both king and courtiers might
deem it good policy to seem to be in great wrath for sometime,
which would make the corporation the more ready to part with
their cash.&nbsp; The successful termination of this business is
thus noticed in the Town-books&mdash;&ldquo;November 2nd. 1672,
Ordered the Town Seal to be fixed to an instrument acknowledging
his Majesties grace and favour in pardoning the Corporation for
making of farthings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How many of these farthing coinages were undertaken by this
corporation, it does not seem very easy to ascertain; <a
name="page826"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 826</span>nor are we
able to discover when this measure was here first resorted to, or
adopted.&nbsp; The present writer is in possession of several
Lynn farthings, but they appear to have been all issued either in
1668, or in 1669.&nbsp; Whether or not any have been issued here
before 1668 he is not able to say.&nbsp; He has seen farthings of
other towns of a much earlier date, and has himself a
<i>Bristol</i> farthing of 1652, which is the earliest of these
town tokens he remembers to have met with.&nbsp; It is likely
that Lynn was led into this coining adventure by the example of
other places, and especially Norwich, which may be presumed to
have been previously concerned in this business. <a
name="citation826"></a><a href="#footnote826"
class="citation">[826]</a>&nbsp; The same offence had been
committed earlier, oftener, and later, by many, if not by most of
its neighbours, so that it must be somewhat odd that the
resentment of the court should appear so bitter towards this
town, beyond what it seems to have been towards other offending
places.&mdash;<i>Norwich</i>, <i>Yarmouth</i>, <i>Diss</i>,
<i>Thetford</i>, <i>Bury</i>, <i>Ipswich</i>, <i>Lowestoft</i>,
and other towns, all, if we are not mistaken, coined and issued
farthings, and Wisbeach <i>halfpence</i>; yet we do not find that
they were brought into any mighty trouble, or alarm, like Lynn,
on that account.&nbsp; However this might be, these private
coinages seem to have been discontinued every where soon after
1670, and never more resumed till within these last twenty or
thirty years, when they became again very general, in consequence
of the example of the Paris-mountain copper Company, in the Isle
<a name="page827"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 827</span>of
Anglesey, who issued large penny pieces, which were for some
years very common, and in extensive circulation.&nbsp; They have
been latterly suppressed, with all the others to which they had
given rise.&nbsp; Government seem resolved to prevent or
discourage any thing of the kind being again attempted; for which
we impute to them no blame, and sincerely wish we had no greater
grievance to complain of.</p>
<p>Between the borough, or corporation of Lynn, and the parish of
Allhallows, or Allsaints, alias South Lynn, there has been for
ages, at times, no very good understanding.&nbsp; That parish has
been too often treated like a younger brother, or a weaker
neighbour, though we know not that it ever appears to have
advanced any unreasonable claims.&nbsp; About the year 1672, some
difference seems to have arisen between the two parties, about
the participation or distribution of the benefit derived from the
duty of 12<i>d.</i> in the chalder upon coals brought by
strangers and delivered <i>in South-Lynn parish</i>.&nbsp; The
borough, or great parish of St. Margaret, claimed the whole, as
their exclusive right, but affected to condescend, at last, to
allow a <i>third part</i> of the same to the South-Lynnians, as
an act of generosity.&nbsp; The latter, by their agent, Tho.
Hugins, consented to this, in consideration that their poor rates
were moderate and easy, compared with those of Saint
Margaret&rsquo;s parish, which were said, even then, to be very
heavy.</p>
<p>The South-Lynnians, however, as appears by their old
Parish-book, considered that there was here some <a
name="page828"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
828</span>over-reaching, or foul play, on the part of the mayor
and burgesses, and that their agent, Hugins, had been taken in on
this occasion.&nbsp; So they really appear to have viewed this
business.&nbsp; But the mayor and corporation viewed it
differently; and the following is their representation of it, as
given in the Hall-books&mdash;&ldquo;October 17. 1672: Whereas
there is due unto the mayor and burgesses, from Mr. Thomas Hugins
and others of South Lynn, divers sums of money, arising upon the
duty of coales bought by them of strangers, and whereas they have
earnestly requested, forasmuch as the said duty doth arise for
coales landed or sold within the said parish of South Lynn, that
a third part of the said moneys may be allowed unto the said
parish of South Lynn for the benefite of the same parish, to be
employed by the paritioners according to the meaning of the order
for that purpose, in regard of their present great charges.&nbsp;
Thereupon this House doe think fitt to order that the same be
allowed accordingly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus we see that the
corporation did not appear disposed to acknowledge that their
South Lynn neighbours had any direct right to this allowance.</p>
<p>The mayor and corporation were very culpable, not only in
granting their neighbours of South-Lynn, with such ill grace, a
third part of the duty on coals delivered there by strangers, but
also in refusing to accede to any such measure till now; which
appears to have been really the case.&nbsp; To have been a little
more neighbourly and accommodating would have been much more to
their credit and their interest.&nbsp; But nothing better, <a
name="page829"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 829</span>perhaps,
could be expected from them, as things then stood.&nbsp; Could
they have foreseen the humiliating and mortifying condition, into
which their illtreated neighbours would bring them in the course
of a few months after, there is reason to believe they would have
used them with a greater degree of gentleness and
condescension.&nbsp; The fact is, they had been at bitter
variance with them for several years, about the obligation of
keeping up and repairing the <i>Long Bridge</i>, which they would
fain throw entirely upon them.&nbsp; But that they were not able
to effect, though they actually went to law with them for that
very purpose.&nbsp; This memorable law-suit forms a prominent
feature in the history of Lynn at that period: an account of it
has been preserved in the old Parish-book of South Lynn, and is
given as follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">South Lynn
Allhallowes</span>, <i>March</i> 25 1674.&mdash;<i>At a
Congregation met and assembled to take the report of Tho. Hugins
concerning Long Bridge and other business treated about and
considered of by him with the mayor and burgesses of Lynn Regis
as followeth hereunder</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Memorandum</i>: That whereas the bridge commonly
called Long Bridge, standing over Sandringham Ea, (alias White
Friars Fleet,) is and hath been long time in great decay, and
contest hath long time been between the mayor and burgesses of
King&rsquo;s Lynn, and the inhabitants of South Lynn, which of
them should repair it: We the inhabitants of South Lynn taking it
into consideration and not being very willing to contest with the
said mayor and burgesses, if that by a way of treaty <a
name="page830"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 830</span>with them
the difference might be composed, did, upon the 13th of April
1669. make our request to Samuel Barron Esq. Thomas Spencely
gentleman, and Thomas Hugins, inhabitants of this parish, that
they would treat with the mayor and burgesses concerning the
premisses: what they, or any two of them did agree concerning the
same we would condescend unto, as it is recorded in this book the
said 13. April 1669.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now this daie one of the said Committee, named Thomas
Hugins, (the other two being lately dead,) doth make report unto
us, that notwithstanding they oft made request unto the mayor and
burgesses to treat about the same, they commonly did refuse to
meet, and the bridge being much in decay the country did indyte
the mayor and burgesses and inhabitants of South Lynn at the
country Quarter Sessions held in Lynn 16. January 1671.&nbsp; We
traversed it against the mayor and burgesses, and then and there
by verdict of the Jury the mayor and burgesses, were found
guilty, and the court did set but a small fine upon them of
3<i>l.</i> expecting they would forthwith repair it.&nbsp; But
they still continued refractory, and said they would try it at
the assizes: Whereupon we prepared for tryal, and I Thomas Hugins
did attend at the next assizes held at Thetford, 12. March 1671,
2; with five witnesses, and did retain three counsels, and was at
the charge of two copies of the charter of K. Edward VI. and one
of Q. Mary to the mayor and burgesses: and notwithstanding their
former word, that they would try it there, and Henry Bell
alderman, and Mr. Farrow their recorder, and <a
name="page831"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 831</span>Mr. Francis
Rolph (Rolfe) their town-clark were there, they did then refuse
to try it, nor did not but put us and themselves to further cost
and charges; The Bridge being more and more in decay, the country
did still complain, and in the month of July, 1672, the mayor and
burgesses did appoint a committee to treat with us, and we did
meet at the house of Mr Samuel Barron, but still they did wholly
refuse to be at any cost or charge, notwithstanding we did offer
them that if a rate were made for the repair thereof through the
whole borough, of which we are part, that we of this parish would
willingly have paid our proportion, which would have been a
fourth part, if not more; and this they would not accept of
neither: And then it was proposed to refer it to four men in the
country, two for them and two for us; and when they had nominated
two for them and accepted of by us, all the gentlemen in the
country would not afford two for us that they would accept of;
but they had always something or other to object against them: so
jealous were they of the men, and indeed of their cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So nothing [being] done, and the assizes at Thetford
drawing towards, I Thomas Hugins, by request of the above-said
Samuel Barron and Thomas Spencely, (they not being in health, nor
in capacity to go abroad) did make address to Mr Seth Hawley,
mayor, desiring him to use his interest that his committee would
once again meet and treat with us, to see if it might not be
determined between us.&nbsp; The said mayor did acquaint <a
name="page832"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 832</span>the Hall
with it, and then they added Mr <i>Farrow</i>, their
<i>recorder</i>, to the committee, but after that no meeting; for
the mayor did once in place where I was present desire the said
Mr Farrow, that he would meet and treat with us: he did
peremptory reply to the mayor, he would not meet, and said to the
mayor, it was but spending of 20<i>l.</i> at the assizes, and
there would be an end of it; and so it fell out [as] to the end,
tho&rsquo; not the end as he dreamt of: for at the assizes held
at Thetford the 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7th. of March 1672 <a
name="citation832a"></a><a href="#footnote832a"
class="citation">[832a]</a> it was there tried, and the mayor and
burgesses were found guilty; which trial was after this
manner&rdquo;&mdash;<a name="citation832b"></a><a
href="#footnote832b" class="citation">[832b]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Messrs. Farrow and Rolfe, recorder and town-clerk,
retained three counsels to plead for them.&nbsp; The South
Lynnians, by their attorney, Jacob Wrag, retained also three
counsels and a serjeant at Law.&nbsp; When they came to the
indictment, it lay against the inhabitants of King&rsquo;s Lynn
and those of South Lynn.&nbsp; But <i>lord Chief Justice
Hale</i>, [before whom this cause was tried,] understanding by
our attorney and counsel, that it was the mayor and burgesses we
complained of, and producing to my lord the true copies of the
aforesaid charters, whereby it appeared that Edw. VI. had granted
lands and tenements in King&rsquo;s Lynn and South Lynn,
amounting to the value of several 100<i>l.</i> a year, for the
purpose of their maintaining of <i>bridges</i>, and jetties
against floods, &amp;c, Q. Mary&rsquo;s charter also concurred
with this; as did likewise the verdict of the jury in 1671, which
was then also produced.</p>

833</span>&ldquo;His lordship taking these things into
consideration, and regarding the obstinacy of the mayor and
burgesses, notwithstanding the former verdict; and he having then
in court advised the bridge being repaired by a rate through the
whole town, [as the South Lynnians had before proposed] which
they [of the opposite party] there in court refused:&mdash;His
lordship then said, if we and they would join issue to traverse
it, he would know who ought to repair it, and he would take such
course in the recording that it should never come before a judge
of assize again to determine it.&nbsp; After some discourse [the
cause went on.]&nbsp; But one witness for the mayor and
burgesses, Thomas Williamson, carpenter, who swore that he had
done some repairs to the bridge in 1654 with his master Robert
Hart, and were paid by two of the inhabitants of South Lynn: but
they appeared to be tenants of the mayor and burgesses, and had
got the money from them to pay the carpenters, as far as
Williamson knew.&rdquo;&nbsp; [His evidence therefore could be of
no avail; and he seems to have been the principal and only
witness on the side of the corporation.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus [adds the MS.] the proud were infatuated in their
own wisdom by their book, paper, and witness! that we of the poor
parish of South Lynn had not one witness examined; the court
thinking it needed not: for their charters, the verdict as
aforesaid, their own books and papers, and their witness there
was enough.&nbsp; Upon which judge Hale said to the jury, they
must bring in their verdict in <i>three</i> parts; for they must
answer <a name="page834"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
834</span>him three questions he should ask them.&nbsp; The jury
went out, and when they came in again, his lordship asked them,
Whether the inhabitants of King&rsquo;s Lynn were guilty, or not
guilty?&nbsp; They answered, <i>not guilty</i>.&nbsp; <i>Record
that</i>, said my lord.&nbsp; He queried 2ndly, Whether the
inhabitants of South Lynn were guilty, or not guilty?&nbsp; They
answered, <i>not guilty</i>.&nbsp; <i>Record that</i> saith my
lord.&nbsp; He asked 3rdly, Whether the <i>mayor and
burgesses</i> were guilty, or not guilty?&nbsp; They answered,
<i>guilty</i>.&nbsp; <i>Record that</i>, saith my lord.&nbsp;
Then he asked the jury, Why they found the mayor and burgesses
guilty? and they said, for that the mayor and burgesses had many
lands and tenements, the gift of K. Edward VI. to the yearly
value of some 100<i>l.</i> given to them for that end and
purpose.&nbsp; <i>Record that also</i>, said his lordship.&rdquo;
<a name="citation834"></a><a href="#footnote834"
class="citation">[834]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus was this vexatious dispute put to rest and settled beyond
the possibility of being ever after litigated.&nbsp; The mayor
and burgesses appear on the occasion in a very unfavourable and
unamiable light.&nbsp; That great and good man, and most upright
and eminent judge, Sir Matthew Hale, before whom this cause was
tried, must have thought, and evidently did think very
indifferently <a name="page835"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
835</span>of them, as no better than a nest of oppressors and
tyrants.&nbsp; Who but they would have run the risk of being
thought ill of by such a man?&nbsp; But corporations are seldom
deterred from evil by the fear of disgrace, for they consider the
odium of their misdoings as greatly diminished, if not quite
annihilated, by being shared among so many: and when a member is
reproached for any corporate or municipal misdeed, he generally
contrives to excuse himself and lay the whole blame upon others
of the brotherhood, whom however he will seldom condescend to
name.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>History of Lynn continued from</i> 1680
<i>to</i> 1688&mdash;<i>Addresses to the throne&mdash;Quo
Warranto proceedings&mdash;surrender and restoration of the
charters&mdash;the revolution</i>.</p>
<p>The years 1680 and 1681 (or 1682) were distinguished here by
two notable addresses to the throne.&nbsp; Of that of the former
year an account has been given already at pages <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page788">788</a></span> and <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page789">789</a></span>, and a rare
piece of curiosity it certainly was.&nbsp; Of the address of 1681
(or 1682) we cannot speak so positively, having never met with a
copy of it; but there is great reason to presume that it was
pretty much of a kin, or not at all dissimilar to the
former.&nbsp; Relating to this memorable document the following
article has been extracted from the Town-Books&mdash;<a
name="page836"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
836</span>&ldquo;March 2. 1681, 2; Ordered that Mr. Recorder
(Henry Ferrour Esq.) be desired to draw up an Humble Address to
his Majestie in abhorrence and detestation of that late designed
traiterous <i>association</i> lately produced at the Old
Baly.&rdquo;&nbsp; This evidently alludes to a circumstance that
transpired in the course of the proceedings that had then lately
been carried on against the earl of <i>Shaftsbury</i>, at the
instigation, it seems, of the sovereign, of which an account has
been given by Rapin, Burnet, and other historians.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The king (says <i>Rapin</i>,) passionately
wished to be revenged of this lord, who for sometime had shown
him little regard: To this end he granted a special commission of
Oyer and Terminer to all the judges of the kingdom to sit, the
24th of November, with the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, at the Old
Baily, on the Earl&rsquo;s trial.&nbsp; Eight witnesses were
heard against him, who deposed upon oath many things from his own
mouth, which discovered pernicious designs against the
king&rsquo;s person.&nbsp; But the greatest crime objected
against him was, the copy (or plan) of an <i>Assosiation</i>
(found in his study) against the enemies of the king, of the
protestant religion, and of their country.&nbsp; But
notwithstanding the hopes conceived by the Court, of being freed
from this enemy, the Grand Jury, consisting of one and twenty of
the principal citizens of London, considering that the paper
containing the association was only a copy, and not writ in the
earl of Shaftsbury&rsquo;s hand, and observing very great
improbabilities in the depositions of the witnesses, found no
sufficient ground for the Bill, and returned <a
name="page837"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 837</span>it
<i>Ignoramus</i>.&nbsp; Immediately the whole city testified
their joy for the earl&rsquo;s deliverance, by bonfires in all
the Streets, and other marks of satisfaction; and the witnesses
against him were in great danger of being torn in pieces by the
mob.&rdquo; <a name="citation837"></a><a href="#footnote837"
class="citation">[837]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arbitrary and vindictive as these proceedings of the Court
were, they appear to have been entirely approved of by our
corporation.&nbsp; Of the conduct and principles of Shaftsbury
and the country party they evidently had no opinion.&nbsp; They
were ready to condemn them without hesitation and without mercy:
and as to the very idea of an <i>association</i> to counteract or
check the tyrannical measures of the Court, it was looked upon by
them as truly horrid and detestable.&nbsp; Yet it was to
something of that kind, a few years after, that we owed our
glorious revolution, our deliverance from popish superstition and
despotism, and the establishment of civil <a
name="page838"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 838</span>and
religious liberty. <a name="citation838"></a><a
href="#footnote838" class="citation">[838]</a>&nbsp; This
Corporation afterwards seemed no less pleased with the
proceedings of William and the revolutionists than they had been
before with those of Charles and his cabal, or of James and his
popish counsellors: and had the pretender succeeded in 1715, or
in 1745, they would probably have been as joyful on that, as they
had been on any former occasion, and addressed the new sovereign
with a zeal no way inferior to what they had expressed or
manifested towards the most favoured and patriotic of his
predecessors.&nbsp; In short, like most corporations, their
conduct would have been regulated by circumstances or self
interest, rather than by truth or genuine patriotism.</p>
<p>Great and notorious as had been the obsequiousness and
devotedness of this corporation to the two last of the Stuart
princes, it did not give them entire satisfaction.&nbsp; They
wanted to have this, and all other corporations that sent members
to parliament, completely in their own power, so as to have their
parliament-men to consist solely of such as they should please to
appoint; that is, of the tools or minions of the court; which
would bid fair always, to insure a parliamentary majority.&nbsp;
To accomplish this, it was necessary to abolish, or disannul all
the Charters, and grant new ones on such terms as would enable
his majesty to appoint all the leading men or municipal
functionaries, and remove at any time all such as he should find
unfit for his purpose, and replace them with such as would prove
perfectly ductile and manageable.&nbsp; This, no doubt, was
deemed by many a <a name="page839"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
839</span>deep and well-laid scheme, which entitled its
projectors to the reputation of being endowed with uncommon
sagacity.&nbsp; But they never could bring it to bear, so as to
realize the hopes they had conceived from it; and it was at last
abandoned: when the former charters were restored, and things
reverted again into their old channels.&nbsp; Of the process or
trial of this notable experiment here, the following, it is
presumed, is a fair and correct representation.</p>
<p>Lynn had not the honour of being the first of our corporations
that was made to experience this mode or description of the
<i>royal touch</i>.&nbsp; The precedence, as on other occasions,
was given to the corporation of London, against which a <i>Quo
Warranto</i> was issued in 1683; in the event of which the judges
of the court of King&rsquo;s Bench declared, that the liberties
and privileges of the city of London were forfeited, and might be
seized into the king&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; It was not till the
following year that it came to the turn of Lynn to be questioned
on a similar account.&nbsp; Accordingly we find the following
notice of it in the Town-Books&mdash;&ldquo;May 26. 1684.&nbsp;
This day the mayor, (Benj. Keen Esq.) aldermen, and common
councell of this Burgh, <i>with one assent and consent</i>, have
ordered, consented, and agreed, that all and singular the powers,
franchises, liberties, priviledges and authorities whatsoever and
howsoever granted to the mayor and burgesses, or to be used or
exercised by or under them, by virtue of any charters, letters
patents, custome or prescriptions now <a name="page840"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 840</span>in force, of or concerning electing,
nominating, or appointing any person or persons into any the
offices of magistracy or places of trust within this Burgh, Be
<i>fully and freely surrendered</i> unto the King&rsquo;s most
excellent Majestie, and that an Instrument for that purpose be
forthwith drawn and prepared to be sealed with the common Seale
of this Burgh at the next Hall: and it is ordered that a
committee be appointed and empowered, as deputies and attorneys
for the mayor and burgesses, to attend the King&rsquo;s Majestie,
with the instrument of surrender aforesaid, as <i>the act and
deed of the mayor and burgesses</i>.&mdash;May 29.&nbsp; This day
the Letter from Lord Townshend, High Steward, resigning his
Patent, being read, was delivered to Mr. Mayor till the same be
further considered.&mdash;This day the Instrument of surrender
was sealed.&mdash;June 9.&nbsp; This day the Instrument of
deputation to surrender the Charter and Liberties was signed; and
the deputies are ordered and authorized to petition his Majestie
to regrant, renew, and confirm such liberties, franchises, and
powers as his Majestie in his princely wisdom shall think proper
for his service, and the good government, profit and interest of
this burgh. <a name="citation840"></a><a href="#footnote840"
class="citation">[840]</a>&mdash;July 24.&nbsp; This day the
charter <a name="page841"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
841</span>of our most gracious Lord and King, renewed and
confirmed to the mayor and burgesses, dated 9th. instant, was
read in the outward open Hall. <a name="citation841"></a><a

6th.&nbsp; The Duke of Norfolk by his Majesties Charter being
appointed High Steward, 10<i>l</i>, the ancient annual Fee, is
ordered to be paid at Christmas yearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a change was now effected here as thoroughly corresponded
with the royal policy.&nbsp; Our Corporation <a
name="page842"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 842</span>continued
subject to this new order of things afterwards, for several
years; even till within a few weeks of the Revolution.&nbsp; The
king, dying a few months after he had granted his second Charter,
had little opportunity to act much upon it, or give it its full
operation.&nbsp; All that was left for his brother and successor
<i>James</i>, who took special care that it should be rendered
sufficiently operative.&nbsp; He, accordingly, in the Summer of
1688, thought proper to set it in motion, and play it on our body
corporate with full and terrible effect.&nbsp; <i>Fifteen</i> of
that body, not thought well of by his majesty, and including the
<i>mayor</i> himself, the Town-Clerk and <i>five aldermen</i>,
were then expelled the Hall in one day, and replaced by others
who were more to their sovereign&rsquo;s liking.&nbsp; Of this
memorable event there are the following memoranda in the
Hall-Books.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;June 11th. (1688) Whereas by order of

</blockquote>
<p><a name="page844"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 844</span>The
king appeared now bent upon persevering in these arbitrary
measures; and in the following month of September, he issued his
royal mandate for continuing as chief magistrate, during another
year, the above mentioned <i>John Davy</i>, who seems to have
been highly thought of by his sovereign, and, but for the
revolution, might, perhaps, have been appointed mayor of Lynn for
life.&nbsp; Of the said royal mandate the following notice is
taken in the Hall-Books.&mdash;&ldquo;Sept. 29. 1688.&nbsp; This
day a madat [mandate] under his Majesties hand and seal was read,
to elect and continue John Davy mayor for the ensuing year,
without administring any oaths but of office.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
it is added&mdash;&ldquo;This day John Davy Esq. is elected mayor
for the next year, by the common councell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dark and humiliating as was the aspect of this new order of
things, it continued only between four and five <a
name="page845"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
845</span>years.&nbsp; The last charter which reduced the
corporation to so degrading a condition was granted in June 1684;
and it was cancelled, in effect, or disannulled in the autumn of
1688, when the old Charters were again restored and the former
order of things reestablished.&nbsp; Of these events the
Hall-Books contain the following memoranda&mdash;&ldquo;October
20. 1688: This day his Majesties Royal Proclamation for restoring
Corporations to their antient Charters, Liberties, Rights and
Franchises bearing date 17th. October being read in this House,
and thereupon the several members of this Corporation being

Norfolk is elected and confirmed Lord High Steward of this
Burgh.&rdquo;&mdash;Under the same date the following memorandum
is inserted&mdash;&ldquo;In pursuance of an order from the office
of Ordnance, signifying his Majesties Commands to send all the
Guns to Hull, it is agreed to remove the same accordingly.&rdquo;
<a name="citation845a"></a><a href="#footnote845a"

things were going on thus at Lynn, the prince of Orange arrived;
which brings us to the happy era of the Revolution, and to the
close of this chapter.</p>
<h3><a name="page848"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
848</span>CHAP. VI.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">History of Lynn from the Revolution to the
present time.</p>
<p>The change which took place at the accession of William and
Mary we denominate, by way of eminence, <i>The Revolution</i>,
and sometimes, <i>The glorious Revolution</i>.&nbsp; It was
certainly a most happy change for this nation, and very different
from that which took place at the restoration of Charles
II.&nbsp; The nation behaved now like people in their senses; but
they behaved then like madmen, and were accessary to all the
enormities of that detestable reign, and of the whole period from
the restoration to the revolution.&nbsp; Had the people, or their
leaders, done their duty at the Restoration, neither Charles nor
James would have found it so easy a matter as they did to
tyrannize over their subjects, and enslave their country.&nbsp;
They were placed on the throne, like all other despots, not only
without any terms or stipulation in favour of the people, but
even with those <a name="page849"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
849</span>lofty notions which they inherited from their
predecessors, and in which they were confirmed by their priests
and courtiers, and other sycophants, that they were
<i>absolute</i> princes, who ruled by right divine, and so were
not amenable to any human tribunal, or accountable to any earthly
being for any of their actions.&nbsp; With such notions we need
not wonder at the arbitrary measures they pursued, or at their
wishing to be as absolute or uncontrolled here as their cousin,
Lewis XIV, was in France, or the grand Seignior in Turkey.&nbsp;
It was very natural for such men as they to be or to do so, and
for their fawning and time-serving courtiers to encourage them in
it: but for the whole church and priesthood to act herein as
abettors, till James, rather impoliticly, proceeded to take some
undue liberties with the hierarchy, is somewhat more
remarkable.&nbsp; As to <i>Charles</i>, he took special care to
keep fair with the prelates and mother church, and play into
their hands to their utmost wishes, which enabled him to rule as
despotically as he pleased, with or without a parliament: they on
the other hand complimented him, by calling him <i>most sacred
majesty</i>, and telling, even the Almighty, that he was <i>a
most religious king</i>.&nbsp; But <i>James</i> departed from
this wise policy of his brother, by presuming to encroach upon
the sacred prerogatives of the church, and order the very bishops
to read, and cause their clergy also, in all the churches,
publickly to read his <i>Declaration of Liberty of Conscience to
all his subjects</i>; which, certainly, was, in itself, no very
unreasonable demand.&nbsp; Yet this was the rock on which he
split, and the occurrence <a name="page850"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 850</span>which most of all contributed to
facilitate and hasten the Revolution.&nbsp; For it caused such an
accession to the patriotic party as rendered it predominant and
irresistible.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> I.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>A sketch of the Revolution</i>, <i>or brief
observations on that memorable and interesting event</i>.</p>
<p>The English Hierarchy, or national priesthood, is that body,
of all others, which it most behoves a tyrant king to secure its
attachment and cooperation.&nbsp; Nor will he find this attended
with much difficulty, provided he take care not to encroach on
the ecclesiastical department, and let the ecclesiastics
tyrannize as much as they please in their own province.&nbsp;
<i>Charles</i> II understood this subject well, and by that means
could act the tyrant with perfect safety throughout his whole
reign.&nbsp; The alliance between church and state was by him
preserved inviolate; and consequently none of the enormities of
his vile government were able to shake, or endanger his
throne.&nbsp; But <i>James</i>, by violating that alliance,
deprived himself of his chief support and bulwark, and lost every
thing.&nbsp; Had he kept fair with the church, or the
ecclesiastics, he might venture to play the despot, persecute the
nonconformists, and other descriptions of his subjects, as much,
and as cruelly as he pleased: they would once have remonstrated
<a name="page851"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 851</span>against
that sort of conduct.&nbsp; But being himself a non-conformist,
and assuming a <i>dispensing power</i>, and issuing a Declaration
for <i>liberty of conscience</i>, and withal, interfering with
the <i>dignities</i> and <i>revenues</i> of the <i>church</i> and
<i>universities</i>, they were alarmed beyond measure, and all at
once forgot, even their favourite doctrines of passive obedience
and nonresistance, for which they had so long contended, and the
disbelievers of which they had so often represented as vile
miscreants, unentitled to the common comforts of society, or the
natural rights of men.&nbsp; While the nonconformists and the
laity were the only sufferers from the oppressions of government,
they blamed them for complaining, and preached up passive
obedience and nonresistance, and the divine right of kingship; <a
name="citation851a"></a><a href="#footnote851a"
class="citation">[851a]</a> but when those oppressions began to
affect them, they immediately changed their tone, and appeared
among the foremost to complain, and even to disobey and
resist.&mdash;Such was the character of the English clergy,
before and at the Revolution; and it deserves to be noted and
remembered.</p>
<p>In imprisoning the bishops, James filled up the measure of his
folly and infatuation.&nbsp; It converted a large majority of his
subjects into enemies, and hastened that crisis which blasted all
his prospects, and transferred his kingdom to another family.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The imprisonment and trial of the seven
bishops, (says an excellent historian, <a
name="citation851b"></a><a href="#footnote851b"
class="citation">[851b]</a>) were the last measures of
infatuation that remained.&nbsp; When a second indulgence was
issued, and ordained to be read in the church, the bishops
petitioned <a name="page852"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
852</span>against an order calculated to reduce the clergy, on
their compliance, to the contempt and reproach of becoming
accessary to their own destruction; or to subject the disobedient
to the penalties recently inflicted by the high commission.&nbsp;
The whole nation was agitated at the imprisonment of the fathers
of the church.&nbsp; The same violent agitation was excited by
their trial; but their acquittal resounded through the capital,
and was received with tumultuous joy by the whole kingdom, as a
religious and even a national triumph over the sovereign.&nbsp;
From the public ferment, which was not likely to subside, that
dangerous crisis had at length arrived, to which despotism and
bigotry conducted James.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eyes and expectations of men had been long fixed on
his nephew, the prince of Orange, whose marriage with his eldest
daughter had opened a near prospect of obtaining the crown.&nbsp;
Religion, as well as interest, had connected William with the
popular party, as alike adverse to the ambition of France, and
impatient for a protestant successor to the English throne.&nbsp;
The discontented found a secure asylum in Holland, and an
honourable or secret reception at his court; and his connexion
with every party was preserved and enlarged by their
correspondence with their friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the chance of a protestant succession remained,
the prince was averse to a premature rupture, and the nation was
desirous to await the natural course of events.&nbsp; But the
birth of a son, during the ferment excited by the imprisonment of
the bishops, consoled James with <a name="page853"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 853</span>the prospect of a catholic heir, and
accelerated every preparation for his ruin.&nbsp; The most
injurious surmises had been entertained of the queen&rsquo;s
conception; and from some mysterious circumstances, the report of
a supposititious child, however improbable at present, was
eagerly propagated and implicitly believed.&nbsp; From the
prospect of an hereditary religious despotism the invitation of
the prince of Orange was no longer deferred.&nbsp; The whigs, who
had urged the exclusion, were indifferent to the hereditary line
of succession, from which the tories, who had no view beyond a
parliament, were unwilling to deviate.&nbsp; But as every
political and religious party deposited their animosities during
the common danger, a secret conspiracy was formed by their
coalition, the most extensive perhaps, and the best concerted
which history has preserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The secret, although entrusted to many thousands,
transpired only from the preparations of the prince of
Orange.&nbsp; Although his declaration announced that he was
invited over by divers of the temporal and spiritual lords, the
king was unable to discover the lines of conspiracy with which he
was surrounded at home.&nbsp; The declaration issued on the
embarkation of the prince, enumerated the grievances of the three
kingdoms, the suspicious birth of the prince of Wales, and the
necessity of interposing to establish the religion and liberties
of the people on a secure foundation.&nbsp; Terrified at the
approaching danger from abroad, and at the contempt and hatred
which he had incurred at home, the king endeavoured, when too
late, to retract his former illegal <a name="page854"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 854</span>measures; but when the Dutch fleet
was dispersed, and driven back by a storm to Holland, his
confidence in the protection of heaven revived.&nbsp; But the
expedition was renewed in a few days.&nbsp; While the English
fleet was confined to its station off Harwich, the prince, with
six hundred transports and ships of war, passed with an east wind
through the Straits of Dover, in the presence of wondering
multitudes, who gazed at the sublime spectacle from either coast;
and disembarking at Torbay, afforded a signal proof to the
nation, that its navy will not always prevent an invasion, nor a
standing army ensure stability to the throne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a few days the prince of Orange was joined by none;
but when the first example was given, the extent of the
confederacy was announced by a rapid and universal defection from
the king.&nbsp; The gentlemen of Somerset and Devon hastened to
the prince, who had advanced to Exeter, and entered eagerly into
an <i>association</i> for his support.&nbsp; The earl of Bath
admitted his fleet into Plymouth.&nbsp; The earl of Devonshire
and the gentlemen of Derby and Nottingham declared for the prince
and a free parliament.&nbsp; Lord Delamer took arms in Cheshire;
and in the northern counties lord Danby and his associates
surprised Newcastle, York, and Hull.&nbsp; Cornbury, the earl of
Clarendon&rsquo;s son, was among the first to desert; but when a
petition for a free parliament, signed by nineteen peers and
prelates, was evaded, he was followed by Churchill, Kirk,
Trelauny, Drumlanrig, the dukes of Ormond and Grafton, prince
George of Denmark, the king&rsquo;s Son in law, while a <a
name="page855"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 855</span>greater
number of inferior officers refused to fight against the prince
of Orange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The king, who had arrived at Salisbury to give battle
to the prince, was overwhelmed with misfortunes.&nbsp; All
England appeared in commotion.&nbsp; The capital was full of
discontent; the very fleet declared for a free parliament; and
surrounded, as he believed, by a disaffected army, he knew not in
whom to confide.&nbsp; He withdrew his army, and retired to
London; but when informed of his daughter the princess
Anne&rsquo;s escape, &ldquo;God help me,&rdquo; cried he, with
tears of anguish, &ldquo;my own children have deserted
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Every new disaster increased his
perturbation.&nbsp; He summoned a council of peers; issued writs
for new parliament; dispatched commissioners to propose a treaty:
but as the prince, amidst the acclamations of all ranks,
continued to advance, he was bereft of all fortitude and strength
of mind.&nbsp; His conduct was irresolute, pusillanimous, absurd;
and unable to submit to necessity, yet incapable of a single
effort of generous despair, he sunk, without dignity, beneath his
misfortunes.&nbsp; His father&rsquo;s execution was still present
to his desponding thoughts; and he listened credulously to every
suggestion of personal danger, without reflecting either on the
difference of the characters or of the times.&nbsp; His terrors
were flattered as the result of political wisdom, and he was
easily persuaded that his departure would produce a scene of
anarchy to accelerate the recovery of absolute power.&nbsp; His
hopes were absurdly placed on the public confusion, <a
name="page856"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 856</span>to increase
which he recalled and burnt the writs for a new parliament;
directed Feversham to disband the army; threw the great seal into
the Thames; and with a single attendant, embarked in a small
vessel at midnight for France, whither the queen and his son had
before been secretly conveyed.&nbsp; When he was intercepted at
Feversham and brought back to Whitehall, the returning affections
of the city might have convinced him that the nation was not yet
lost.&nbsp; In this delicate extremity he attempted to resume his
authority by an indiscreet proclamation against the late
excesses; <a name="citation856"></a><a href="#footnote856"
class="citation">[856]</a> but was required at midnight to remove
from the palace, and permitted to retire to Rochester, with an
obvious design to connive at his escape.&nbsp; He was convinced
himself that his departure would prove acceptable to the prince;
and the few friends who adhered in adversity to his fortunes,
urged him to remain.&nbsp; But the despair of life
returned.&nbsp; An expression of his father&rsquo;s was
remembered&mdash;that &lsquo;short is the distance between the
prison and the grave of kings:&rsquo; and by the desertion of his
kingdom, which he was destined never to revisit, he left his
rival an unbloody victory, and a vacant throne.&mdash;The
revolution was accomplished in Scotland with the same ease and
success.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A convention was assembled in each kingdom, to manage their
respective concerns, and settle their future government.&nbsp; In
England the revolution was accomplished <a
name="page857"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 857</span>by a
coalition of whig and tory; but in Scotland, where the same
distinctions prevailed under different names, the parties kept
separate and opposed to each other; the episcopalians siding with
James, and the presbyterians with William.&nbsp; The latter,
however, in the end prevailed, and the convention adopted a plan,
prepared by a committee, for the settlement of the crown.</p>
<p>The deliberations had degenerated in the English convention
into verbal disputes between the two houses, whether the late
king had deserted or abdicated the vacant throne.&nbsp; In
Scotland there was neither the same necessity to gratify the
tories, nor the same propriety in declaring that the king had
abdicated the government, by the desertion of a country wherein
he did not reside.&nbsp; But the opposite genius of the two
nations was never more conspicuous than in the result of their
deliberations on that important event.&nbsp; The <i>English</i>
convention declared that James II. having endeavoured to subvert
the constitution, by breaking the original contract between the
king and people, and having violated the fundamental laws, and
withdrawn from the kingdom, had <i>abdicated</i> <a
name="citation857"></a><a href="#footnote857"
class="citation">[857]</a> the government, and that the throne
was thereby vacant.&nbsp; The <i>Scots</i>, on the other hand,
instead of <a name="page858"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
858</span>attempting by an ambiguous fiction to reconcile
hereditary right with a change in the succession, placed the
vacancy of the throne on its true basis, the religion and
mal-administration of James.&nbsp; The same oppression which the
English apprehended while yet distant, they had long
endured.&nbsp; Their loyal attachment to the Stewarts, which
survived the civil wars, had been effaced by their sufferings
since the restoration.&nbsp; From the same national ardour which
rendered the reformation so complete, or destructive in Scotland,
they proposed and passed a bold and decisive vote, that James had
forfaulted [<i>forfeited</i>] the crown by his misconduct and
crimes.</p>
<p>When the throne was declared vacant, the convention, of both
nations, resolved that the crown should be tendered to William
and Mary, as joint sovereigns.&nbsp; The prince in an agreeable
and obliging manner accepted of the crown in the name of them
both; and the same day, (Feb. 13. 1689,) they were proclaimed
king and queen by the named of William and Mary, at which a
general joy appeared among the people.&nbsp; On the 11th. of
April the new sovereigns were crowned in London, and proclaimed
in Scotland on the same day.&nbsp; From the latter Argyle and
others were deputed by the three temporal estates to present the
crown, and administer the oath to the king and queen.&nbsp; The
instrument of government and the grievances were first read; to
which an Address to turn the convention into a parliament, was
subjoined.&nbsp; When the coronation Oath was administered to
William, at the obligation to <i>root </i><a
name="page859"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 859</span><i>out
heretics</i>, he paused, and declared that he did <i>not mean to
become a persecutor</i>; and on the assurance of the
commissioners that such was not its import, protested that in
that sense only he took the Oath.&nbsp; This must be extremely
honourable to William&rsquo;s memory, and is a rare instance of
princely virtue, wisdom, and patriotism.&nbsp; If all kings were
of his sort the objections to monarchical government would lose
most of their strength.&nbsp; With this sketch of the British
Revolution, so much talked of, and so ill understood by most, the
reader, it is hoped, will not be displeased. <a

<p>William&rsquo;s ideas of civil and religious liberty, though
perhaps, not perfectly correct or unexceptionable, were yet far
more so than what was generally entertained by our countrymen at
that period&mdash;and probably, even what is generally
entertained among us at this time: <a name="page860"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 860</span>for civil and religious liberty
seems not to have been of late years among our favourite
studies.&nbsp; William and his consort would gladly have placed
the liberty of protestant Dissenters on a broad and liberal
footing, but it was not approved by the majority of the two
houses of parliament.&nbsp; They however readily passed an Act,
in the summer of 1689, for <i>exempting their Majesties
Protestant Subjects dissenting from the Church of England from
the Penalties of certain Laws</i>; which is commonly called the
<i>Act of Toleration</i>.&nbsp; But <i>toleration</i> is a word
not to be applied to honest and virtuous men, in a land of
liberty; for it implies some unworthiness in the objects, or
their being unentitled to what is granted, and that the
magistrate grants it by way of favour, indulgence, or connivance;
whereas religious liberty is the natural and inalienable
inheritance of every human being, and should be claimed as a
right, and not as a boon or favour.&nbsp; The Toleration Act
received the royal assent May 24. 1689, and the protestant
dissenters have sat under the shade of it, mostly, but not always
unmolested, ever since.&nbsp; Tories and high churchmen have
often attempted to disturb them, but by this law they have been
in a great measure protected.&nbsp; Had it not passed in the
reign of William, it is doubtful if it had passed at any
subsequent period.&nbsp; Even at this time some great men are
proposing to have it revised, as being too comprehensive, and
requiring certain restrictions.&nbsp; What the event will be,
time will shew: but it will be a sad thing if the rights of
conscience, or the enjoyment of religious liberty should be
curtailed, now in the 19th century.</p>
<p><a name="page861"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 861</span>Lynn
is a notable instance of a town declaring for the revolution,
without entering at all into the spirit of it: for it continued
still as bigoted and intolerant as before.&nbsp; This was
remarkably exemplified in the bitter and violent persecution that
broke out here about 1690, against a society of protestant
dissenters of the Baptist denomination, and especially against
<i>James Marham</i>, their minister.&nbsp; He appears to have
been a very worthy man, zealous and diligent in propagating that
sort of religious knowledge which he thought most useful and
interesting to his fellow-creatures.&nbsp; Some of the great
ones, or heads of the town became his chief persecutors.&nbsp;
What they affected to take most umbrage at was, the denomination
to which he belonged.&nbsp; They pretended that it was a
<i>new</i> religion; and they would not suffer it to be
disseminated in the town, but were resolved to break up the
meeting.&nbsp; They first proceeded against him under the
Conventicle Act, and employed two men, named <i>Robert
Whitehead</i> and <i>Henry Oseincraft</i>, as <i>informers</i>;
who having been at the meeting, laid their information before the
justices, or aldermen, <a name="citation861"></a><a
href="#footnote861" class="citation">[861]</a> who forthwith
issued their warrants to levy 20<i>l.</i> on the <i>house</i>,
20<i>l.</i> on the <i>preacher</i>, and 5<i>s.</i> on each of the
<i>hearers</i>.&nbsp; Marham owned that he hired the
meeting-house, but produced <a name="page862"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 862</span>the licence, or certificate, which
shewed it to have been regularly registered as a place of
worship, according to the Toleration Act; but that they
over-ruled, and caused their levy to be executed, both upon him
and others.&nbsp; And finding afterwards that he persisted in
continuing the meeting, they resolved to ruin him, by charging
him with some heinous crime, which the account does not
specify.&nbsp; They got one person to swear against him,
intending then to commit him to prison; but the witness could not
substantiate the charge; so that they were obliged to drop the
proceeding.&nbsp; Marham now getting a copy of their levy, found
that the informers had sworn, that when they were at the
meeting-house one <i>John</i> Marham was <i>preaching</i>;
whereas there was no preacher of that name.&nbsp; The preacher
that was speaking when they were at the meeting was a minister
from London, whose name was <i>Wm. Lang</i>, but he was only
<i>praying</i>, and not preaching, at the time.&nbsp; They had
also sworn, that one <i>Francis Robinson</i> was then at the
meeting, which was not true.&nbsp; Having made these discoveries
Marham was advised to proceed against them at common Law, which
he accordingly did; and the two informers were put into the crown
office.&nbsp; The great men now interfered, and prevailed with
Marham&rsquo;s attorney to desist from further prosecution,
&ldquo;as he would answer it, (says the account) in the hands or
<i>custody of a messenger</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation862"></a><a href="#footnote862"
class="citation">[862]</a>&nbsp; These threats inducing the
attorney <a name="page863"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
863</span>to stay the proceedings for a time, the informers,
advised by their patrons or employers, took advantage of that to
remove the cause from common law to chancery.&nbsp; A notice or
subp&oelig;na was then served upon Marham to answer their bill of
complaint, which bill consisted of 31 sheets.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though
the substance of it, (our account says) <i>will be proved utterly
false</i>, yet it will cost more money by far than Marham is able
to disburse, without <i>evident ruin</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; An appeal
was therefore made to the whole denomination for assistance; and
they are thought to have come forward pretty liberally on the
occasion, the <i>particular</i> as well as the <i>general</i>
baptists, to the latter of which Marham belonged.&nbsp; He was up
in London and gave in his answer in February 1693; but when or
how the affair ended does not appear, for our account was
published before it was brought to its final issue.&nbsp; As a
chancery cause it might remain long undetermined, perhaps for
some years.&nbsp; But how or whensoever it ended, here is enough
to shew very clearly with what illiberality, intolerance,
tyranny, and villany, the gentry or chief men of Lynn were
capable of acting at that period.&nbsp; Much of the same spirit
continued here very long after, even down to the memory of the
present writer.</p>
<p><a name="page864"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 864</span>About
the beginning of 1690 (or 1689&ndash;90) the <i>hosiers</i> of
this town appeared much concerned and alarmed, (as had indeed
been the case for some time before, <a name="citation864"></a><a
href="#footnote864" class="citation">[864]</a>) at the prevalence
of the <i>weaving</i> method, by which that of <i>knitting</i>
was much discouraged and fallen off, to the great injury of vast
numbers of the poor, who were consequently left without
employment.&nbsp; They therefore now petitioned the Hall to have
the case brought before parliament, which was readily acceded
to.&nbsp; This affair is thus memorized in the
Town-Books.&mdash;&ldquo;Jan. 17. (1689&ndash;90)&nbsp; On
petition of the Hosiers of this Town in behalf of the poore,
against the new invention of <i>weaving</i> worstead hose;
whereby many thousands of the poor are destitute of employment;
It is ordered and agreed that a Petition from this House to the
Honorable House of Commons representing that grievance, now read,
be sealed with the common seal of this burgh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may therefore be presumed that this petition was actually
presented to the House of Commons, but what was there made of it,
or what reception it met does not appear.&nbsp; It must, however,
have indicated a very contracted idea of trade, or the rights of
manufacturing adventurers.&nbsp; Near seven years after a
different sort of petition was presented by this town to the same
house; of which the <a name="page865"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 865</span>following notice occurs in the Hall
or Town-Books&mdash;&ldquo;Oct. 26. 1696; Mr Mayor, Mr Recorder,
Sir Henry Hobart baronet, Sir John Turner knight, Sir Charles
Turner knight, Robert Walpole, Maurice Kendall, Esquires, Mr.
Bell, Mr. Holly, Mr. Turner, or any five of them, to manage and
present a petition to the parliament to remove obstructions, and
for preserving navigation&mdash;[and] for removing the Dam and
Sluices near Salters load.&rdquo;&mdash;The obtaining the object
of this petition might probably have proved very beneficial to
the country; but it does not appear that the application
succeeded.</p>
<p>Our corporation, as might be expected, did not neglect during
this reign to send some loyal <i>addresses</i> to the
throne.&nbsp; How many they actually did send we have not the
means of ascertaining.&nbsp; One was probably sent upon their
majesties accession, though we have not met with any particular
account of it.&nbsp; We are indeed informed in our extracts from
the Hall-Books, that Thursday, the 11th of April 1689, the day of
the coronation of King William and Queen Mary, was appointed
<i>to be kept here with all due solemnity</i>: whence one might
pretty safely infer, that an Address did soon after follow.&nbsp;
Such was the case, we presume, with all the rest of our
corporations.</p>
<p>Another address was sent from Lynn in 1696, occasioned by the
discovery of the <i>assassination plot</i>, and the intended
French <i>invasion</i>.&nbsp; One of our historians <a
name="citation865"></a><a href="#footnote865"
class="citation">[865]</a> <a name="page866"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 866</span>speaking of that horrid plot, thus
adds&mdash;&ldquo;At the same time there was to be an invasion
from France, for which purpose king <i>James</i> was come to
<i>Calais</i>, and the troops, artillery, and stores, were
immediately ordered to be embarked; but by the news of the
assassination plot having miscarried, and the speedy sending of a
formidable fleet under admiral <i>Russell</i>, this other part of
the design was frustrated; and Calais was not long after
bombarded by the English.&nbsp; The king on February 21.
acquainted parliament with the discovery of the plot; upon which
both Houses addressed his majesty to congratulate him on his
happy preservation: and the House of Commons drew up and
subscribed an <i>association</i> to stand by one another in
defence of his majesty&rsquo;s sacred person and government,
against the late king James and all his adherents.&nbsp; The
Lords also agreed to the same association; and the example of the
two Houses was followed by all the corporations in the
kingdom.&rdquo;&mdash;The part which Lynn took in this memorable
business is thus noticed in the book of extracts from the Hall
records&mdash;&ldquo;March 11th. (1695&ndash;6) sign&rsquo;d an
Address to his Majestie in the nature of ane Association to stand
by and assist his Majesty against all his Ennemys
whatsomever.&rdquo;&mdash;We have seen no copy of this
address.</p>
<p>On the king&rsquo;s return from the continent, in the autumn
of 1697, another address went to him from this town, of which the
following is a copy&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Great Sir.&nbsp; Wee your Majesties most
dutifull and loyall subjects, the mayor, aldermen, and
common-councell, and chiefe inhabitants of the burgh of
King&rsquo;s Lynn in the <a name="page867"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 867</span>county of Norfolk, crave leave to
prostate ourselves at your Royall feet, with sincerest joye and
most devout thankfulness adoreing the Divine Goodness for
watching over your pretious life (in all the Dangers it has been
exposed to by sea and land) upon the safety whereof the fate of
so many nations did depend.&nbsp; The comfort is too bigg for us
to express, To behold your sacred person with happyness and honor
retorned to these your dominions after the vast toyles of a war
ingaged in for the security of your realms and the tranquillity
of Europe.&nbsp; For no sooner had your princely tenderness
secured to us the inestimable blessings of Lawe, Liberty, and
Religion, but injured and ruined provinces abroad implored your
ayd.&nbsp; Then it was you awakened the slumbering genius of this
warlike people, and with matchless conduct, courage, vigilance,
you led forth the British forces to fame and great atchievements
in forreign lands.&nbsp; Let other chiefes and potentates of your
allyance have their deserved praise; but it is your majesties
right for what by your councell and armes has been done in
accomplishing the great worke to remain possest of the brightest
share of the glory that attends it, will outweigh the pomp of all
other triumphs to be the chosen instrument of Providence to calm
a stormy world, to make wars and desolation to cease, and to
restore repose and peace to christendome.&nbsp; May the same
propitious providence make these blessings durable and
perpetuall, may your sacred Majestie be still the charge of the
Life Guards of Heaven, may your royall cares be sweetened, though
they can never be requited, by the constant loyalty and duty of a
gratefull people; may your days be <a name="page868"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 868</span>long and prosperous, and your
renoune increase; may your Realms flourish in virtue, union,
plenty and peace; and when you shall be called to a heavenly
crowne may generations to come rise up and call you
blessed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Address, no doubt, was drawn up by one of our first
orators and ablest hands of that day, and in his very best
manner.&nbsp; But our augustan age does not appear to have
commenced till after the accession of Q. Anne.&nbsp; Our
addresses to the throne became then long and frequent; and they
were all penned in so striking a style of eloquence as clearly
evinced the abundant confidence the compilers had in their own
parts and powers.</p>
<p>In 1697 our corporation had a law-suit with one <i>Hulton</i>,
before Lord Chief Justice Holt, which by the following hint in
the Hall-Books they appear to have gained&mdash;&ldquo;March 29.
1697, Recovered, on a tryall before Lord Chief Justice Holt, of
Leonard Holton a Quitt rent of 23<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per annum,
and arrears for 38 years to Michaelmas 1694, on his house, late
Th: Toll Esq: and also a rent charge of 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> per
annum.&rdquo;&mdash;In the same year they had also a suit in the
court of Exchequer, with one <i>Vinckeson</i>, of which the
following notice occurs in the Hall-books&mdash;&ldquo;June
16.&nbsp; Ordered that Hubert Vinckeson be prosecuted in the
court of Exchequer for the duty of Lastage of great quantities of
corn and graine belonging to fforreigners and strangers to the
liberties of this burgh, which have been unjustly coloured and
own&rsquo;d by him, contrary to his aath of
ffreedome.&rdquo;&mdash;It does not appear that there was any
thing unjustifiable in this prosecution.</p>
<p><a name="page869"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 869</span>About
this same period our <i>water-works</i> appear to have been a
losing concern to our corporation; which they seem to have felt
so far as to have the following notice of it inserted in their
books&mdash;&ldquo;April 20. 1696.&nbsp; It is reported that the
charges and disbursements of maintaining the water-rents for ten
10 years last past, as per particulars is 1427<i>l.</i>
7<i>s.</i> <a name="citation869"></a><a href="#footnote869"
class="citation">[869]</a> 8<i>d.</i> the rents and profits
thereof for the sametime is 1338<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i>
2<i>d.</i>&mdash;Lost by the water account in ten years
288<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> which divided by ten years is
28<i>l.</i> 17<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per annum.&rdquo;&mdash;How
this concern turned out afterwards, or how it stands at present,
we have not had hitherto the means of ascertaining.</p>
<p>At this period which we are now reviewing the whole body of
our <i>coal-meters</i> and <i>head-porters</i> brought themselves
into most sad disgrace, by certain dishonest and fraudulent
doings.&nbsp; The customhouse complained against them and had
them all turned out at once:&mdash;but some weeks after, on
profession of contrition or promise of amendment, they were again
restored.&nbsp; Of this unpleasant affair, so disreputable and
humiliating to these meters and porters, our Corporation have
preserved the following memorial in their books&mdash;&ldquo;July
11th. 1701; Upon Information this day made to this House by the
chief officers of his Majesties Customes of this Port against the
whole body of the Company of Head Porters and Metters of the Port
and Burgh, that they have severally received deputations and
instructions from the Right Honorable the Lords Commissioners, <a
name="page870"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 870</span>as metters,
weighers, and measurers, in pursuance of an act for granting to
his Majesty severall duties upon coales and culme, have every one
of them taken and received bribes, and made short and false
certificates and retornes, and been guilty of other corrupt ill
practices contrary to the said trust and the oath and duty of
their offices of Head Porters and Metters, and to the defrauding
his Majestie of the said Duties; which upon examination they have
this day severally confest: it is therefore this day ordered that
all and every of them be and stand discharged from the said
offices of Head Porters and Metters of this burgh and
port.&rdquo;&mdash;Then we read as follows&mdash;&ldquo;August
13.&nbsp; Upon the humble application and submission of divers of
the corne and coale metters, head porters, this House hath
reestablished them, and ordere&rsquo;d that beside the accustomed
oath they give security by bond with one surety in 20<i>l.</i>
for the just performance, and so to continue for the
future.&rdquo;&mdash;This regulation is probably still in
force.</p>
<p>About the same time our corporation appeared to claim kindred
and fall passionately in love with gentility and high life, or
the titled classes of the community, as contradistinguished from
the unprivileged orders or swinish multitude; which is evinced by
the conclusion of the following passage in the Hall-Books, on the
regulation of Tolls,&mdash;&ldquo;Nov. 24. 1701; Ordered that the
present Tables of Petty Tolls, taken by water and at the gates,
be regulated according to the alterations now made, and such as
are now marked be exchanged, and that new tables thereof be made
to be hung up at the <a name="page871"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 871</span>gates, and delivered to the
wharfinger; and that <i>all Noblemen</i>, <i>Knights</i>,
<i>Esquires</i>, and <i>Clergymen be from henceforth exempted
from all Tolls for goods bought by them</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; One can
perceive in this neither justice nor charity; and it was probably
the offspring of mere caprice.</p>
<p>At the period now under review our clergy were, seemingly,
treated, or provided for by the corporation more liberally and
handsomely than they are at present.&nbsp; In 1702 the minister
and lecturer had their Stipends augmented to 100<i>l.</i> a year
each; which must have been equal to 3 or 400<i>l.</i> at least,
of our money.&nbsp; Before that time they had but 50<i>l.</i>
each, as appears by the following articles in the
Hall-Books&mdash;&ldquo;Aug. 29, 1701; Ordered that Mr. Th: Pile
be appointed minister or preacher at St. Nicholas Chaple to
preach once every Sunday, and to read divine Service once every
day in the week, except Sundayes, at St. Margarets Church, and he
shall be allowed 50<i>l.</i> per
annum.&rdquo;&mdash;again&mdash;&ldquo;March 18. 1701; Dr. Th:
Little chosen Lecturer at St. Margarets Church, in the room of
Mr. Fysh deceased, and to have 50<i>l.</i> per
annum.&rdquo;&mdash;again&mdash;&ldquo;Nov. 20. 1702; Mr. Th:
Pyle and Dr. Little&rsquo;s stypends <i>augmented more</i>
50<i>l.</i> <i>per annum each</i>, on Mr Jaggard&rsquo;s
decease.&rdquo;&mdash;If we are not mistaken, there has not been
afterwards any further augmentation for 60 or 70 years; when
50<i>l.</i> more were added to the minister or vicar: and the
same has been added lately.&mdash;Being now brought to the close
of William&rsquo;s reign, and the accession of Anne, we shall
here finish this section.</p>

<p>On the death of King William, Anne, the younger sister of his
late queen, succeeded to the throne, by virtue of the <i>act of
settlement</i>, which had passed in the preceding reign.&nbsp;
She was proclaimed on March 8, 1701&ndash;2, a few hours after
the king&rsquo;s death; and her accession gave entire
satisfaction to all her protestant subjects.&nbsp; Those of this
town appeared on that occasion very conspicuous, as they were
actually among those who addressed the throne within that
selfsame month. We have never seen a copy of this address, but
have learnt from our book of Extracts that it was dated March 30,
1702.&nbsp; Whether it was long or short, we know not; but there
can be no doubt of its being very loyal: and, in point of style
or diction we may take it for granted that it bore no small
resemblance to those of succeeding years, of which we shall not
fail by and by to exhibit some fair specimens.</p>
<p>About the time of which we are now speaking, Lynn was thought
to be in some danger from the encroachment of the tide upon that
point called the Boale, or world&rsquo;s end; and the most
effectual means that could <a name="page873"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 873</span>be thought of were therefore adopted
for the safety of the town.&mdash;This affair is thus noticed in
the Hall books:&mdash;&ldquo;Sept. 24. 1708; In pursuance of a
late order wee have considered Robert Elsden&rsquo;s Petition to
us referred, and taken a view of the ground called the Boale or
World&rsquo;s End, and the lands and houses on either side, and
are of opinion, that there is an absolute necessity that the said
ground as it now is be preserved from being lost to sea, and for
that purpose that some present meanes be considered by Jettys and
Counter-shores to repell the flow and reflow the sea, without
which the houses on the north side of the Mill ffleet, and
consequently the town will be in great danger of ruin; and
considering how necessary it is that present care be taken of the
defence of the town so incumbent upon this House, which the said
Elsden is in no wise able to performe, and also considering the
advantage it will be to this corporation to have the duties of
wharfage and groundage, stakes, mooreage and other dutys claimed
and long enjoyed the owners of that ground united and made entire
to this port, Wee have treated and contracted with the said
Robert Elsden for the absolute purchase of the said ground and
all profits and advantages thereunto belonging for the sum of
130<i>l.</i> and 20<i>l.</i> more at the end of five years if the
said ground shall continue so long preserved from sea without
considerable diminution.&rdquo;&mdash;Then it is
added&mdash;&ldquo;Said Report and Articles are read and well
approved by this House.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was, no doubt, an
advantageous bargain to the corporation; and as might be
expected, they <a name="page874"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
874</span>now set themselves in good earnest about effectually
preserving their new purchase.&nbsp; They laid out upon it a good
deal of money; of which the following memoranda occur in their
books&mdash;&ldquo;Sept. 29. 1704: Ordered 100<i>l.</i> to be
taken up for reimbursing the chamberlain&rsquo;s charges about
the Jetties and defences against the sea at the Boale, or
World&rsquo;s End.&rdquo;&mdash;again&mdash;&ldquo;Jan. 12
1704&ndash;5: Ordered that Mr. Hainsworth chamberlain&rsquo;s
account audited at 347<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> relating to
the Boale be allowed, and that he have 10<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>
for his extraordinary trouble.&rdquo;&mdash;This spot, we
presume, has been ever since the property of the corporation,
which we cannot find to have been ever the case before.</p>
<p>About this same time happened that dreadful national calamity,
commonly called <i>the great storm</i>, the most tremendous and
most disastrous, perhaps, ever experienced in this kingdom.&nbsp;
It continued for several days but was at the highest on the 27th
of November 1703.&nbsp; No place escaped its fury, but in some
places it was most awfully terrible and destructive.&nbsp; It
blew from the <i>west</i>, and therefore could not so much affect
this coast; and at Lynn the loss it occasioned was comparatively
inconsiderable; amounting to seven or eight ships, twenty or
thirty hands, and damage to the houses, or buildings, computed at
about 1000<i>l.</i> and the whole including the shipping to about
3000<i>l</i>, <a name="citation874"></a><a href="#footnote874"
class="citation">[874]</a> which was but a <a
name="page875"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 875</span>trifle,
compared to the losses which some other places had then
sustained.</p>
<p>On the western coast the ravages of this storm far exceeded
what they were in these eastern parts.&nbsp; At <i>Bristol</i> it
occasioned so high a tide as did above a 100,000<i>l.</i> damage
to the merchants goods only.&nbsp; It also caused the
<i>Severn</i> to break down its banks, and overflow a vast tract
of land, by which 15000 sheep, besides other cattle were
drowned.&nbsp; The famous <i>Eddystone</i> Lighthouse also, which
had borne several storms unmoved, was not able to stand
this.&nbsp; It was swept off on the tremendous night of the 27th.
and nothing was to be seen the next morning but the bare
rock.&nbsp; <i>Winstanley</i> too, its ingenious projector and
constructor, who happened then to be there, perished with the
rest. <a name="citation875"></a><a href="#footnote875"
class="citation">[875]</a>&nbsp; Soon after, on that very night,
the <i>Winchelsea</i>, a homeward bound Virginia-man, split on
the same rock, and most of its hands were lost.</p>
<p>It was computed that no less than 300 sail of ships, some of
them belonging to the royal navy, were lost <a
name="page876"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 876</span>on
different parts of out coasts, and that there were drowned then
in rivers and at sea, at least 8000 persons.&nbsp; Between one
and two hundred lost their lives by the fall of houses, chimneys,
&amp;c. and a still greater number were grievously bruised and
hurt from the same causes.&nbsp; More than 800 dwelling houses
were blown down, and barns and outhouses without number.&nbsp;
Above 400 wind-mills were overset and destroyed; upwards of one
hundred churches were uncovered, and the lead from some of their
roofs blown to an incredible distance: many of their steeples and
battlements were also demolished.&nbsp; In addition to all which,
above 250,000 trees were said to be then torn up by the
roots.&nbsp; In short the whole country for sometime after
exhibited the appearance of dejection, dismay, and
desolation.</p>
<p>The public feelings being greatly affected by this national
calamity, we need not be surprized that a general <i>fast</i> was
soon after solemnly proclaimed and devoutly observed throughout
the kingdom; and though we may not very readily fall in, or
coincide with every idea suggested in the royal proclamation, <a
name="citation876"></a><a href="#footnote876"
class="citation">[876]</a> yet we cannot <a
name="page877"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 877</span>help
looking upon that fast as much more proper and justifiable than
most of those that have been observed by our countrymen ever
since.&mdash;After all, what were the deplorable ravages of that
great and mighty storm, compared with those of a single campaign
in some of our modern wars, when myriads of human beings have
miserably perished, entire provinces cruelly laid waste, and
whole nations involved in utter ruin?&nbsp; Yet these most
calamitous scenes are seldom looked upon by governments and
nations as the judgments of Heaven, or what ought to lead men to
serious reflection, religious humiliation, and repentance.</p>
<p>In the course of the following year, (1704) our national
feelings were very differently affected.&nbsp; The dejection of
the preceding year was no longer felt, and the public mind became
suddenly elated in a wonderful manner, and to an extraordinary
degree.&nbsp; This was occasioned by the battle of
<i>Hochstet</i>, or <i>Blenheim</i>, as we most commonly call
it.&nbsp; That surprising victory filled the nation with such
vainglorious triumph as to throw it almost into a state of
atheistical intoxication.&nbsp; Addresses <a
name="page878"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 878</span>to the
throne came in thick now from all quarters, and our corporation
appeared conspicuous among those memorable addressers.&nbsp; Our
address was not a little remarkable; but whether most so for its
piety, good sense, and elegance, or for its loyalty, adulation,
and fustian, or bombastry, may be left for the reader to judge.
<a name="citation878"></a><a href="#footnote878"
class="citation">[878]</a></p>
<p><a name="page879"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 879</span>But
however loyal or patriotic we seemed at this period, and elated
with the idea of our military successes and national glory, we
yet lay at the same time under some very unfavourable and
disreputable imputations from some of our neighbours, on the
score of extortion, or unwarrantable and exorbitant exactions in
our commercial dealings.&nbsp; Nor is it at all clear that the
charge was absolutely or entirely groundless.&mdash;These
circumstances appear from the following document in the
Hall-books.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jan. 12th. 1704&ndash;5.&nbsp; Whereas
Petitions have been lately exhibited to the Honourable House of
Commons in Parliament by the Deputy Leuftenants, Justices of the
Peace, Gentlemen and Inhabitants of the Countys of Bedford and
Huntingdon, complaining of great duties and payments exacted by
this town of Lynn by force of pretended By-Laws on all such sea
coales brought into this port as are not consumed in this town,
and for that under a pretence of a certain custome of <i>Foreign
bought and foreign sold</i> all masters of ships and others not
free of this corporation who bring in coales are compelled to lye
three market days after arrival before they are permitted to sell
their coales to any person whatsoever; and after they have layn
such time yet they are permitted to sell to non but Freemen and
<a name="page880"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
880</span>inhabitants of the burgh at their own prices, whereby
all other traders in Sea coales are discouraged, that trade
monopolised there, and the prices raised to an excessive rate,
and that the freemen and inhabitants thereby make exorbitant
gains to themselves, to the great oppression of the petitioners
and diminution of the queen&rsquo;s revenue, which custom and
practices are contrary to divers laws and statutes, viz. 9th of
Ed. 3 and 25th. Ed. 3. and 11th. Rd. 2. and therefore pray to be
relieved against them.&mdash;And whereas the matters in said
petition are referr&rsquo;d to a private committee it is ordered
that Councell be taken in said case, and that such concession and
disclaims <a name="citation880a"></a><a href="#footnote880a"
class="citation">[880a]</a> be made before the committee or
otherwise as by our Burgesses in Parliament with advice of such
Councell shall be thought reasonable touching the duty of
8<i>d.</i> per Chalder and compelling Strangers ships to lye 3
days mentioned in the said case, and to act farther therein as
they shall see cause, <i>saving</i> to this corporation the
ancient <i>custome of fforeign bought of foreign sold</i>, and
the <i>duty</i> 4<i>d.</i> <i>per chalder</i> time out of mind
received and injoyed.&rdquo; <a name="citation880b"></a><a
href="#footnote880b" class="citation">[880b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How this affair terminated we have not been able to
ascertain.</p>
<p>Soon after the affair just now mentioned another circumstance
transpired which had a still more serious aspect on our
corporation, as it seemed to involve them <a
name="page881"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 881</span>in a kind
of dispute with the crown itself, and to threaten them with a
repetition of former alarming regal procedures, or another
deprivation of their charters and municipal franchises.&nbsp; A
process was accordingly commenced against them on the part of
their sovereign, for the embezzlement, or non-payment of certain
royal dues; and it is thus noticed in their own
records&mdash;&ldquo;June 13th. 1705; upon reading a writt
directed to the sheriffe of this county, for seizing into Her
Majesties hands the liberties of this Burgh, for default of
entering claims, and answering and accounting for the debts,
fines, and forfeitures due to Her Majestie arising within this
Burgh.&nbsp; It is this day ordered that the Town Clerke
forthwith take care to cause appearance to the said writt, and
such other matters be performed as are incumbent on the mayor and
burgesses.&rdquo;&mdash;It is not said what was the result, but
it may be supposed to have ended favourably, though, probably,
not without absolute submission and great expense.&nbsp; But for
any disloyalty that might be alleged against them in this
instance, they seem to have made ample amends by their memorable
address to the throne in 1706, which shall be given in the next
section.</p>
<p>Among the advantages enjoyed formerly by the minister of the
town, or the vicar of St. Margaret&rsquo;s parish, was that of a
<i>parsonage house</i> for his habitation.&nbsp; This house was
situated in <i>Webster&rsquo;s row</i>, or Broad street.&nbsp;
For sometime before the period of which we are now speaking there
seems to have been some doubt, whether <a
name="page882"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 882</span>this house
belonged to the corporation, or to the Dean and Chapter of
Norwich.&nbsp; But now, during the deanship of the celebrated
<i>Dr. Prideaux</i>, the Dean and Chapter expressly relinquished
their claim in favour of the corporation.&nbsp; But this is
supposed to have proved to succeeding ministers an unfortunate
relinquishment: for it does not seem that they had any longer an
appropriate mansion in the town, but were obliged to shift for
themselves, and procure a dwelling as they could, like the rest
of the inhabitants.&nbsp; How the corporation came to deprive the
minister of his parsonage house we have not learnt.&mdash;Of this
affair the following notice occurs in the Hall-Books;
&ldquo;August 29. 1705; It appeareth by old deeds that the
minister&rsquo;s house in Webster&rsquo;s Row belongeth to the
mayor and burgesses, and Dr. Prideaux, Dean of Norwich, by his
Letter produced doth disclaim the same, as never in possession of
the Dean and Chapter of Norwich.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="page883"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 883</span>In
the summer of 1706, our corporation distinguished themselves by
another most elaborate and pompous address to the throne, which
might well compensate for all that constructive disloyalty, or
treasonable delinquency which seemed imputable to them the
preceding year.&nbsp; Indeed, as far as words could do it, this
address must have placed them among the most loyal, most zealous,
and most devoted of all her majesty&rsquo;s subjects.&nbsp;
Whether she herself deemed it to have completely white washed
them from their former foulness, or not, we are unable to
say.&nbsp; But if she did really condescend to bestow upon it any
thought at all, she could hardly avoid considering it as an
extraordinary production: and the reader will probably view it in
much the same light. <a name="citation883"></a><a
href="#footnote883" class="citation">[883]</a></p>
<p><a name="page884"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 884</span>In
the self-same year, and soon after the date of the said addresses
to the throne, there was here no small stir made about the corn
water-mills, which were situated close by the present Lancastrian
school.&nbsp; From those mills the fleet from thence to the
harbour was called mill-fleet, and the lane adjoining had the
name of mill-lane.&nbsp; Those corn water-mills appear to have
been here long noted, and of great use to the town.&nbsp; But
about <a name="page885"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
885</span>the time of which we are now speaking they were falling
into decay, and so continued till they were at length entirely
laid aside, and every vestige of them has long ago
disappeared.&nbsp; The wind-mills now supply their place and do
their work, at least so much of it as is wanted to be done here;
for the chief of the meal and flour consumed in the town is
brought from other parts.&nbsp; When Lynn depended for its bread
entirely, or almost so, on its water-mills, they must have been
of great consequence, and the laying of them by must have been
much felt by the inhabitants.&nbsp; At present our situation is
very different, and we perceive and feel no need of water-mills.
<a name="citation885"></a><a href="#footnote885"
class="citation">[885]</a></p>
<p><a name="page886"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 886</span>In
the spring of the very next year (1707) another flaming address
to the throne went from Lynn; and as it is not inferior to the
former in point of eloquence and sublimity, it may be desirable
to have it preserved, for the entertainment of the rising
generation.&mdash;It was dated April 25.&mdash;The following is a
correct copy of it, as it stands in our volume of
extracts&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;May it please your Majestie, Nothing could
ever equal your Victories in the field but your Councells in the
cabinet: thus happily in spite of all the Jesuiticall
contrivances of your and our Ennemys to vanquish nationall and
hereditary prejudices, to reconcile so many jarring and different
pretensions, and to unite England and Scotland into one kingdome
and interest, hitherto by all in vain attempted, will together
with the Blenheim and Ramilies remain everlasting monuments of
your Majesties glory.&mdash;Our Protestant succession is hereby
extended thro&rsquo; the British Isle, Our Legislature, Trade,
and Interest one, and all Jealousies and differences being
removed, that <a name="page887"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
887</span>strength which has often been a weakening to us, to the
mutual endangering our constitution and safety, is now become a
real security to both, and formidable to our enemies.&nbsp; Thus
the hopes of our divisions, fomented by a popish Pretender and
his heedless abettors, will be now extinguished, and wee shall
always think it our dutie, as what is most agreeable to your
Majestie and beneficiall to ourselves, to be unanimous with one
another, and to pay a friendly regard to our united Neibours, as
becomes fellow protestants and fellow subjects.&mdash;May your
Majestie, seated on the throne of your united Britannia, long
hold the ballance and arbitrate the peace and safely of Europe,
and be as great and happy here, as your memory will be immortall
and glorious hereafter.&rdquo; <a name="citation887"></a><a
href="#footnote887" class="citation">[887]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We now take our leave of the Lynn Addresses.&nbsp; This and
the two former are probably to be classed among the prime
productions of our augustan age.&nbsp; Our volume of Extracts
contains no more copies of addresses to the throne; which seems
to indicate that a great tailing off took place afterwards in
their style and composition, so that the succeeding ones were not
worth preserving.&nbsp; However that was, these samples have been
here inserted upon the supposition that they <a
name="page888"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 888</span>were some
of the best written and most eloquent that any of our sovereigns
ever received from this borough: and it is in that view chiefly
they are now recommended to the perusal and consideration of the
reader.</p>
<p>In 1708, according to one of our MS. accounts of that time,
two children were hanged here for felony, one <i>eleven</i>, and
the other but <i>seven</i> years of age; which if true, must
indicate very early and shocking depravity in the sufferers, as
well as unusual and excessive vigour on the part of the
magistrates in the infliction of capital punishment. <a
name="citation888a"></a><a href="#footnote888a"
class="citation">[888a]</a>&mdash;In that also and the succeeding
year, the wretched state of the <i>harbour</i> appears to have
occasioned considerable disquietude and alarm in the town; and
the most effectual means that could be thought of were adopted to
remedy the growing evil, and tranquillize the minds of the
inhabitants. <a name="citation888b"></a><a href="#footnote888b"
class="citation">[888b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page889"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 889</span>At
the time now under review, two of the most prominent characters
in this town were the elder <i>Pyle</i> and <i>Dr.
Hepburne</i>.&nbsp; Of the former some account may be expected
hereafter.&nbsp; The latter was a North-Briton, and of the
medical profession.&nbsp; At what time he settled here does not
very distinctly appear; but it is supposed to have been about the
latter part of king William&rsquo;s reign.&nbsp; Be that as it
might, he soon became eminent as a physician, so as to stand at
the head of the profession, in all this part of the kingdom, for
near half a century.&nbsp; Walpole, with our principal nobility
and gentry, held him in high estimation, and his practice became
in time so very extensive that he was seldom to be found at home,
so that the town was obliged then to have recourse for medical
advice solely to <i>Browne</i> and <i>Lidderdale</i> the two
other physicians.</p>
<p>On the 3rd. of February 1709, the Hall voted Dr. Hepburne the
freedom of the town <i>gratis</i>; and he took up that freedom on
the 12th. of the next ensuing August.&nbsp; <i>Browne</i> is
supposed to have had the same compliment <a
name="page890"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 890</span>paid him:
so had <i>Lidderdale</i> on the 29th. of August 1737. so also had
<i>Tayler</i> on the same day of the same month, ten years
after.&nbsp; The last of our physicians, if we are not mistaken,
who have been thought worthy of the honour of being made free of
this ancient and renowned borough, was the late Dr.
<i>Hamilton</i>.&nbsp; He was not, like Paul, <i>free-born</i>,
nor did he, like most of his predecessors, become free
<i>gratis</i>; but might say with the Roman chief captain,
&ldquo;With a great sum obtained I this freedom,&rdquo; for it
cost him at least 30<i>l.</i> which was a great deal more than it
was worth to a mere medical man, fifty years ago.&nbsp; His being
obliged to purchase it, and so dearly too, seems a pretty plain
indication that a change of disposition towards the physicians
had then taken place in the Hall, and that they were actually
sinking in the estimation of that worshipful body.&nbsp; That
same body is supposed to have been no less determined ever since,
even from the commencement of this jubilee reign, against making
any more of the physicians <i>free</i>, than his majesty is said
to be against making any more of his subjects <i>Dukes</i>,
except those of his own family.&nbsp; So remarkable a coincidence
between the humour of our corporation and that of their beloved
sovereign must, no doubt, be very curious to contemplate.&nbsp;
As to the two physicians that are now, and have long been
resident here, the present writer positively disavows any
knowledge or suspicion of either of them being in the least
uneasy in their state of villanage, or at all desirous of
obtaining their freedom.&nbsp; On the contrary, he supposes them
to be perfectly indifferent about that matter; even as much so as
he is himself, who has not the least idea <a
name="page891"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 891</span>that the
freedom of Lynn, or of any other town, would be worth to him a
single <i>groat</i>, or what would afford the smallest
gratification.</p>
<p>Not only the <i>medical</i> profession, but even the
<i>clerical</i> also seems to be in lower estimation here now
than what it was a hundred years ago.&nbsp; The heads of both
professions were then, and long after, we presume, invariably
admitted to their freedom, which is not the case now.&nbsp; The
very <i>Lecturer</i>, if we are rightly informed, is at present
<i>unfree</i>, as well as the physicians.&nbsp; The Vicar also,
as was before noted, had here then a parsonage-house, which he
has not now.&nbsp; Nor is his present stipend, or income, any way
equal to what it was at that period.&nbsp; Yet for all this
seemingly declining credit of these two learned professions among
us, it is more than probable, that both physic and divinity are
as well understood, and as rightly and judiciously administered
here now, as ever they were in the days of Thomas Pyle and George
Hepburne.</p>
<p>In 1713 our corporation, in conjunction with some others,
engaged in a law-suit about Sir Thomas White&rsquo;s benefaction,
<a name="citation891"></a><a href="#footnote891"
class="citation">[891]</a> but it does not appear how it
terminated.&mdash;About the same time, and somewhat earlier, Lynn
must have been much agitated by the affair of Walpole, who was
one of its parliamentary representatives.&nbsp; Because he would
not join with the new ministry, they resolved <a
name="page892"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 892</span>to be
revenged, by accusing him of a breach of trust and
corruption.&nbsp; They finally succeeded, though by small
majorities, and had him committed to the Tower and expelled the
House.&nbsp; Lynn re-elected him, but it was declared null and
void: so he was kept out of parliament till after its
dissolution, which took place on the 8th. of August 1713.&nbsp;
Lynn then again re-elected him, and he sat in the new parliament
which met on the 16th. of February 1714.&nbsp; The queen died a
few months after, and was succeeded by George I. which opened the
way and was the prelude to Walpole&rsquo;s future elevation and
prosperity.</p>

Pretender&mdash;our accounts of this town</i>, <i>during this
reign</i>, <i>very barren of interesting or memorable
incidents&mdash;enumeration of some of the most
remarkable&mdash;the king dies and his son succeeds</i>.</p>
<p>No prince, says Coxe, ever ascended a throne under more
critical circumstances, and with less appearances of a quiet
reign, than George the First; whether we consider the state of
the European powers, the situation of parties in Great Britain,
or his own character.&nbsp; As to the latter, he was ill
calculated by nature, disposition, and habit to reconcile the
then jarring parties, and <a name="page893"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 893</span>remove the unfavourable impressions
which it was natural for all people to entertain of a foreigner,
destined to rule over them.&nbsp; He was already fifty-four years
of age, and had been long habituated to a court of a very
different description from that of England, and to manners and
customs wholly repugnant to those of his new subjects.&nbsp; He
was easy and familiar only in his hours of relaxation, and to
those alone who formed his usual society; not fond of attracting
notice, phlegmatic and grave in his public deportment, hating the
splendour of majesty, shunning crowds, and fatigued even with the
first acclamations of the multitude.&nbsp; This natural reserve
was heightened by his ignorance of the language, of the first
principles of the English constitution, and of the spirit and
temper of the people.</p>
<p>It was currently reported, before his arrival, that measures
were preparing to evade the laws which excluded foreigners from
honours and employments.&nbsp; He had several mistresses, of whom
two the most favoured were expected to accompany him to England,
with a numerous train of Hanoverian followers, eager to share the
spoils of the <i>promised land</i>; to set up a court within a
court, and an interest opposite to the true interest of
England.&nbsp; It was also maliciously circulated that he was
indifferent to his own succession, and scarcely willing to
stretch out a hand to grasp the crown within his reach.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But, adds the same writer, he had excellent qualities for
a sovereign, plainness of manners, simplicity of character, and
benignity of temper; great application to business, extreme
exactness in distributing <a name="page894"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 894</span>his time, the strictest economy in
regulating his revenue; and, notwithstanding his military skill
and tried valour, <i>a love of peace</i>; virtues, however, which
required time before they were appreciated, and not of that
specious cast to captivate the multitude, or raise the tide of
popularity.&rdquo;&mdash;Such was our first sovereign of the
present family. <a name="citation894"></a><a href="#footnote894"
class="citation">[894]</a></p>
<p>A great part of the nation was hostile to the Hanover
succession; but it was a divided party, and could never be
brought to act in concert, or with whiggish energy.&nbsp; The
<i>Tories</i> were then a very powerful body, and mostly in
favour of the Pretender, but not so decidedly as the
<i>Jacobites</i>, who were to a man violent for his
restoration.&nbsp; These two parties were then more numerous and
powerful than the <i>Whigs</i>, or adherents of the House of
Hanover and the protestant succession.&nbsp; But they wanted the
talents, the unanimity, and the decision of the latter, and
therefore proved unable to gain their point, or introduce the
pretender and place him on the throne.&nbsp; An attempt, however,
was made, chiefly in Scotland, to bring him in, in 1715, and
again in 1745; but they both miscarried, so that the present
family in the end got firm and undisputed possession of the
sovereignty of these realms; and the pretending or rival family
is now extinct.&nbsp; Considering the many adverse appearances,
at and before the queen&rsquo;s death, George&rsquo;s quiet
accession was not a little remarkable and surprising.&nbsp; His
success, it has been thought, &ldquo;was principally owing to the
abilities, prudence, activity, <a name="page895"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 895</span>and foresight of the great Whigs,
and to the precautions which they had always taken, and now took
to promote the succession in the protestant line, with whom the
Hanoverian agents in London concerted their mode of conduct, and
to whom George, from the first news he received of the
queen&rsquo;s death, wholly resigned himself and his
cause.&rdquo;&nbsp; In nothing did he discover so much discretion
and wisdom, as in acting under the guidance of such able and
trusty adherents.</p>
<p>The history of Lynn during this reign, seems remarkably barren
of interesting, or very memorable incidents.&nbsp; Scarce any
thing that we know of, relating to this town, occurred within
that time that is worth recording.&nbsp; The town no doubt, or at
least the members of the corporation, derived many good things
from the high station then occupied by Walpole, their great
patron and representative; and this circumstance would hardly
fail to render Lynn the envy of most other corporations, who
would naturally be desirous of obtaining so powerful a
patronage.&nbsp; But upon this subject we will not here
enlarge.</p>
<p>Among the principal objects that engaged the attention of our
corporation during this reign, was an inquiry into the extent and
limits of the estates in Dunham and East Lexham, belonging to the
Gaywood Hospital, of which they were the trustees or
guardians.&nbsp; This inquiry commenced as early as
1710&ndash;11. as appears from the following note or hint in our
volume of Extracts&mdash;&ldquo;March 23. 1710&ndash;11; St. Mary
Magdalen <a name="page896"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
896</span>estate to be surveyed and new
buttal&rsquo;d.&rdquo;&mdash;Afterwards, under the year 1715, we
read as follows; &ldquo;July 27. upon reading the report of the
Comittee, ordered to inspect the Estate in East Lexham and
Dunham, belonging to Gaywood Hospital, It is ordered that a
Letter be sent to Edmd. Wodehouse, Esq. to request and demand a
new particular and abuttals of the lands there late in his
possession, and that the Town Clerk attend the persons employed
to new abuttal the same, as occasion shall require.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This work appears to have been attended with considerable
difficulty, and therefore to have made for a great while but very
slow progress; but our gentlemen still persevered, and seemed
fully determined to effect their purpose, in spite of all
obstacles.&nbsp; Accordingly the affair is thus further noticed
under 1718: &ldquo;April 7th. Ordered a Letter be wrott to Edmd.
Wodehouse, Esq. to desire new abuttals of the lands in Dunham and
East Lexham, belonging to St. Mary Magdalen&rsquo;s Hospitall,
which he and his predecessors have holden 99 years by lease
lately expired.&rdquo;&mdash;A month after (i.e. May 7. 1718.) it
was further &ldquo;ordered that <i>Mr. Mayor</i>, (Ja: Boardman
Esq.) Mr. Turner, Mr. Berney, Mr. Bagge, Mr. Rolfe,
<i>Aldermen</i>; Mr. Robotham, Wm. Allen, Tho. Allen, Town Clerk,
and Chamberlains, be a Comittee to inspect the Hospitall lands
belonging to St. Mary Magdalen, at Dunham and East Lexham, and
settle the schedules, and treat for a new Lease thereof; likewise
to consider of the regaining the foldcourse at Dunham.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page897"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
897</span>Somewhat more than a year and half after the last date,
we find the same business still employing the attention of our
gentlemen.&nbsp; Hence, in our volume of Extracts, the following
passage occurs.&mdash;&ldquo;December 23rd. 1710.&nbsp;
Order&rsquo;d that alderman Bagg, with the town clerk, be desired
to wait upon Mr. Wodehouse at Lexham, and endeavour to ascertain
the lands late in his lease from St. Mary Magdalen&rsquo;s
Hospitall, and enquire after what other lands there are in Dunham
and East Lexham for which no rent is paid.&rdquo; <a
name="citation897"></a><a href="#footnote897"
class="citation">[897]</a>&nbsp; How they succeeded, or how the
inquiry finally turned out, does not appear.&nbsp; But it is
pretty certain that the Hospital and poor pensioners there, have
never owed much obligation to the Wodehouse family; and but for
the interference of the corporation, this charity, in all
probability, had long ago been alienated and lost.&nbsp; Let this
therefore stand on record among the good and worthy deeds of our
body corporate.</p>
<p>The origin of the appointment of <i>Watchmen</i> for this
town, is a circumstance that seems to be very little known here:
but from the following hint in our volume of Extracts, it seems
to be now of near 90 years standing.&mdash;&ldquo;Feb. 3.
1719&ndash;20, Order&rsquo;d that a Letter be sent to the members
of parliament, to gett a clause incerted in the act now about
passing for night watches for the city of <i>Westminster</i>, in
favour of this corporation <a name="page898"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 898</span>to have the like
regulation.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seems probable therefore, that Lynn
had its night watchmen as early as the city of Westminster, and
of course earlier probably, than most other places in the
kingdom.&nbsp; Somewhat more than two months after the last date,
the following circumstance is memorized in our book of
Extracts&mdash;&ldquo;April 6. 1720, Mr. John Cary junr. is
elected Master of the Writting School, and aldermen Berney and
Scarlet, governors and inspectors of the said
schoole.&rdquo;&nbsp; This school still exists; but who are its
present governors and inspectors we have not learnt.&nbsp; They
may be supposed to be expert <i>penmen</i>, or good judges of
penmanship.&nbsp; On the 23rd. of the following December, it was
&ldquo;ordered that a book be prepared to register all the Acts
of our Common Councell that pass the seale.&rdquo;&mdash;This
book of <i>the Acts of our Common Council</i>, though not quite
so interesting as the book of <i>the Acts of the Apostles</i>,
may nevertheless contain some very curious passages, which might
be very useful for this work, could we have been favoured with a
sight of it.&nbsp; But it is supposed to be a book of
<i>secrets</i>, and so not accessible to the uninitiated and
unprivileged.&nbsp; Containing now the acts of near 90 years, it
may be presumed to be, by this time, rather bulky.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1722, our book of Extracts speaks of the
Blockhouse being let on lease to one Quash.&nbsp; The reason of
noticing this here, is, because the passage alluded to shews that
one of the gates of the town anciently stood there, and bore the
name of <i>St. Agnes</i>.&mdash;The passage reads thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;April 4th. 1722, Ordered <a
name="page899"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 899</span>that a
lease be made to Wm. Quash, mariner, of the messuage called the
Blockhouse, in North End, being formerly <i>St. Agness Gates</i>,
for the terme of 99 years, at 10<i>s.</i> per annum, from Lady
Day last, he putting the same into repair, and so keeping it as a
dwelling house during the said terme, and leaving the same in
tennantable repair at the expiration, excepting to this
corporation the common way and passages as usual through the
same.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the 23rd. of the following November, according to the Hall
Books, it was &ldquo;ordered that the tolls for the carriage of
goods through the two gates be suspended for one year, from Lady
Day next.&rdquo;&nbsp; This shews that toll was formerly paid for
the passage of goods through our gates; but we have not learnt
the reason of the suspension of that payment now for one
year.&nbsp; It was a measure, no doubt, which some circumstances
were thought to render necessary, at least by way of
experiment.&nbsp; Its country and commercial connections had long
given Lynn a bad name, for its extortioning spirit, and
exorbitant exactions; and it is probable that the town had
suffered on that account: this might therefore be an expedient
used, along with others, for the purpose of retrieving its
character.&nbsp; Whether it promoted that object in any degree,
or proved of any material benefit to the town, we have not been
able to discover.&mdash;Under the date of March 1. 1722&ndash;3,
(or 1723, as we reckon) the following short note or hint occurs
in our book of Extracts&mdash;&ldquo;Market Tolls declared to be
the Mayor&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; By which it would seem that there
were <a name="page900"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
900</span>before some doubts entertained here upon this subject,
and that it had never been fully settled, till now, to whom those
tolls belonged.</p>
<p>In the following August, the resentment of the Hall, was
excited in a very high degree against Dr. Browne the physician,
for having set up, on some occasion, a kind of competition for
precedence with the very Mayor himself.&nbsp; This daring deed is
thus memorized in our book of Extracts&mdash;&ldquo;August 29.
1723, Ordered that a Letter be written by the Town Clerke to Dr.
Wm. Browne, to acquaint him with the resentment of this
corporation of his affront to the mayor (Richd. Harwich Esq.)
justices and gentlemen of this corporation, by an undue
precedence he assumed and persisted in, on Monday
last.&rdquo;&nbsp; [also] &ldquo;that the Letter now written by
the Town Clerke, on that occasion, be sent to Doctor
Browne.&rdquo;&mdash;Things must have been then queerly situated
at Lynn; especially between the mayor and Dr. Browne.&nbsp; What
effect the Town clerk&rsquo;s Letter had upon the doctor, we have
not been able to discover.&nbsp; But we have always understood
that there was never any great cordiality between him and the
corporation.&nbsp; He resided here long after this, and
afterwards removed to London, where he received the honour of
<i>knighthood</i>, and became <i>president of the Royal College
of Physicians</i>, to the no small gratification of his vanity,
of which he had a most enormous portion.&nbsp; He has been spoken
of as a good physician, but beyond that, or out of the line of
his profession, he is not known to have acquired much
respectability.&nbsp; In one thing he seemed <a
name="page901"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 901</span>more
fortunate than his contemporary Hepburne; for he died
<i>rich</i>, and the other <i>poor</i>.&nbsp; Hepburne&rsquo;s
numerous patients were, it seems, more liberal in <i>feasting</i>
than in <i>feeing</i> him; whereas Browne would not have been
satisfied with that sort of liberality.&nbsp; He was the
grandfather of our present parliamentary representative, Sir
Martin Browne Folkes, baronet. <a name="citation901a"></a><a
href="#footnote901a" class="citation">[901a]</a></p>
<p>In 1724 and 1725, the decayed, unsafe, and dangerous state of
the river and harbour, which had been much complained of for many
years before, continued still to engage the attention of our
rulers, as appears by the following memoranda in the Hall
records&mdash;&ldquo;August 3. 1724; this day <i>Col.
Armstrong&rsquo;s</i> Report concerning the river, with severall
maps, &amp;c. were brought into this House.&rdquo;&nbsp;
again&mdash;&ldquo;Jan. 4th. 1724&ndash;5; To apply to Parliament
for reviving the Extinct Powers for Commissioners concerning the
navigation of the river Ouze.&rdquo;&nbsp;
again&mdash;&ldquo;Febr. 3. appointed a Comittee to state,
settle, and consider of proper ways and means, by tonnage upon
goods imported, to raise 2500<i>l.</i> per annum, stipulated to
be employed in amending and restoring the navigation of this
harbor.&rdquo;&mdash;again <a name="citation901b"></a><a
href="#footnote901b"
class="citation">[901b]</a>&mdash;&ldquo;June <a
name="page902"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 902</span>7th. 1725;
Ordered that <i>Mr. Badslade</i> be paid 20<i>l.</i> for his
disbursements for printing the severall schemes, cases, and
answers, relating to this navigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the latter part of 1726, an affair came on between the
corporation and one <i>Henry Southwell</i>, a freeman, which
ended rather disgracefully to the former.&nbsp; They seized a
quantity of coals belonging to him, under pretence of their being
foreign bought and foreign sold; for which he brought an action
against the Town Clerk, which the corporation defended.&nbsp;
They proceeded further, and actually disfranchised
Southwell.&nbsp; Upon which he procured a mandamus, and obliged
them to restore him to his freedom.&nbsp; This must have been not
a little mortifying to them.&nbsp; They thought they had him
entirely in their power, and could master him; whereas the
mastery, in fact, belonged to him, and it so turned out that they
were in his power: so that like the Irishman, <a
name="citation902"></a><a href="#footnote902"
class="citation">[902]</a> they <i>caught a Tartar</i>, and
thereby brought <a name="page903"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
903</span>themselves into a most humiliating dilemma, and exposed
themselves to the ridicule and derision of the whole
country.&nbsp; The Hall-records notice and memorizet his affair
as follows: &ldquo;Nov. 16th. 1726; ordered that the suit brought
by Henry Southwell, a freeman, against Edw. Bradfield,
Town-clerk, for seizing a parcell of coales, fforeign bought and
fforeign sold, which came into this port in a ship, Wm.
Coverdale, master, a foreigner, for Wm. Taylor, fforeigner, be
defended, at the publick charge&mdash;and that Hen: Southwell be
disfranchised for his collouring bargains and sales, contrary to
his Oath of ffreedom, and using opprobious words (in his Letters)
to the corporation, unless he shews good cause to the contrary,
upon due notice to him for that purpose to be
given.&rdquo;&mdash;again&mdash;&ldquo;Febr. 3rd.
1726&ndash;7.&nbsp; Ordered that Mr. Hen: Southwell, appearing
and shewing no sufficient cause to the contrary, be disfranchised
the freedom of this burgh, and he is disfranchised
accordingly.&rdquo;&mdash;again&mdash;&ldquo;April 29th.
1728.&nbsp; <i>Ordered that the former order</i>, <i>made for
discharging Hen</i>: <i>Southwell of the freedom of this
burgh</i>, <i>be made void</i>, <i>and that he be restored
again</i>, according to the direction of a peremptory mandamus,
issued out of his majesty&rsquo;s court of King&rsquo;s Bench, to
the mayor, aldermen, and common councell for that purpose
directed: and the said Hen: Southwell appearing, was sworn, and
found pledges.&rdquo;&mdash;This might have taught our
corporation a very useful lesson, and been a standing warning to
them never more to act in so arbitrary a manner, or attempt to
extend their power beyond its due bounds.</p>
<p><a name="page904"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 904</span>Being
now come to the close of this reign, it may be proper here just
to mention some of the principal events by which it was
distinguished.&nbsp; Among them the first in order of time was
the <i>rebellion</i> in 1715, in favour of the pretender; which,
though it was suppressed early in the ensuing year, was far from
being eradicated from the minds of the people.&nbsp; The
malcontents were long after very numerous in the kingdom, and
ever busy in forming new plots against the government, of which
that wherein bishop <i>Atterbury</i> was concerned seems to have
been the most formidable.&nbsp; The seasonable discovery of it
prevented its being productive of much mischief, except to the
conspirators themselves, some of whom paid very dear for the
share they had in it; particularly Layer and Atterbury.&nbsp; The
former was hanged and quartered, and the latter banished his
country for ever.</p>
<p>But of all the occurrences of this reign the South Sea scheme,
or grand bubble, as it is sometimes called, was that which proved
most disastrous and calamitous to the nation.&nbsp; This
memorable scheme was laid before the House of Commons by the
South Sea Company, along with another from the Bank of England,
in 1719, for reducing all the public Funds into one, in order to
discharge the national debt, on some valuable consideration to be
granted them, &amp;c.&nbsp; After much debate and contest, it was
determined in favour of the South Sea Company, and their
proposals were accepted on Feb. 1. 1719&ndash;20.&nbsp; An Act
afterwards passed both Houses for that purpose, which received
the royal assent in April following.&nbsp; Upon the proposals
being accepted, stock rose gradually <a name="page905"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 905</span>to a prodigious height; to 310 per
cent. even before the bill received the royal assent; in a few
days to 340, then to 400, and before the end of May to 500.&nbsp;
In short, what by the artifices of the managers, and the
credulity of the people, eager to grasp the riches now held out
to them, by the 2nd. of June it got up to 890, and continued
rising and falling till it amounted to above 1000.&nbsp; Nothing
was now minded but the business of stock-jobbing.&nbsp; Exchange
Alley, where these affairs were transacted, was in a continual
hurry, and thither crowds of all ranks and qualities daily
resorted.&nbsp; The desperate, who ventured first, were generally
gainers, whilst the more wary, who came in later, were many of
them great sufferers: so that the <i>wrongheads</i>, (as the
saying then was,) had the better of the <i>longheads</i>.&nbsp; A
spirit of gaming thus prevailing in the nation, many projects
were set on foot, which obtained the name of <i>bubbles</i>, and
were evidently the progeny of the grand bubble.&nbsp; They were
near 100 in number, and it was reckoned that almost a million and
half was won and lost in them.&nbsp; A proclamation was issued
against them on the 11th. of June, and they were soon after
entirely suppressed by order of the Lords Justices.</p>
<p>As to the South-Sea Stock, it continued to rise till about the
end of August.&nbsp; It then began to fall, and fell faster than
it rose; so that by Michaelmas-day it sunk to 150.&nbsp; In
December it underwent a parliamentary enquiry, which induced
<i>Knight</i>, the South-Sea Company&rsquo;s treasurer to
abscond.&nbsp; In the end, parliament <a name="page906"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 906</span>applied to the relief of the
sufferers the estates of the sub-governor, deputy-governor,
directors, &amp;c.&nbsp; And also that of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, <i>Aislabie</i>.&nbsp; They were also incapacitated
from sitting or voting in either House of Parliament, or holding
any office or place of trust under his Majesty, his heirs, or
successors.&nbsp; The following Summer an Act against the
directors received the royal assent, and shortly after another
<i>for restoring the public credit</i>.&nbsp; The share
<i>Walpole</i> had in settling this distracted affair, and
restoring public credit, brought him into great favour at court,
and facilitated his promotion.&nbsp; He was now made chancellor
of the Exchequer, and first Commissioner of the Treasury, and
continued prime minister to the end of this reign, and fifteen
years after; to the no small benefit, no doubt, of many Lynn
freemen, whatever may be said of the nation at large.</p>
<p>This reign was also distinguished by those memorable religious
controversies which sprung from the novel or unfashionable
opinions advanced and maintained by Clarke, Whiston, Peirce,
Hoadly, and others, and which wrought a considerable revolution
in the minds of a great many, both in the church and among the
dissenters.&nbsp; The athanasian trinity was given up by numbers
of our most learned countrymen; the nature of the kingdom of
Christ, with the measure and extent of the obedience due to the
civil magistrate, became better understood; the injustice and
iniquity of imposing human creeds, or articles of faith, were
more fully evinced; in short, the English nation is supposed to
have <a name="page907"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
907</span>been thenceforth more generally and accurately
acquainted with the principles of civil and religious liberty,
the claims of conscience, and rights of man, than at any former
period.&nbsp; Of late years, however, we are thought to have made
no advances on these grounds, but rather to have been moving in a
retrogressive direction; so that our favourite word
<i>liberty</i> itself would seem to be in danger of losing its
wonted meaning, and becoming a vague, or rather an obsolete term
in our language.&nbsp; Nor will the violent hubbub lately raised,
by Lord Sidmouth&rsquo;s illiberal, illconditioned, illfeatured,
illdigested, and deservedly reprobated bill, be sufficient to
invalidate this opinion.</p>
<p>The effects of the above-mentioned controversies extended even
to this town; and the elder <i>Pyle</i>, who was then at the head
of our established clergy, as well as the elder <i>Rastrick</i>,
who was at the head of the dissenting interest here, were both
actually brought over to what was deemed the heterodox side of
the question.&nbsp; They were men of considerable eminence and
learning, and had been both educated at Cambridge; for Rastrick
was originally one of the established clergy, and had been for
sometime vicar of Kirkton near Boston, before he left the church
and joined the dissenters.&nbsp; But we will say no more of them
here, as we shall have occasion to bring them forward again in
our biographical sketches.&nbsp; The king died suddenly, at
Osnaburgh in his German dominions, on the 11th of June 1727, and
was succeeded by his only son, George prince of Wales, which
brings us to the end of this section.</p>
<h4><a name="page908"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p class="gutsumm"><i>A view of the state of things in this town
during the reign of George II.&mdash;his accession attended with
no inauspicious circumstances</i>; <i>and his reign</i>, <i>on
the whole</i>, <i>happy and prosperous&mdash;recital of some of
the most notable and prominent acts of our municipality in the
earlier part of it&mdash;account of certain subsequent
proceedings and occurrences</i>.</p>
<p>The reign of George II. commenced upon the arrival of the news
of his father&rsquo;s demise, which was very shortly, and within
a few days after that event had taken place.&nbsp; He was
proclaimed in London on the 15th of June, and at Edinburgh and
Dublin on the 19th of the same month.&nbsp; His accession was
attended by none of those untoward appearances which beclouded
that of his predecessor.&nbsp; All the lords and others, the late
king&rsquo;s privy councellors, were sworn of his privy council,
the former ministry retained their places, and Walpole held the
premiership for fifteen years longer; nor was he displaced at
last through any dislike or prejudice which the king had imbibed
against him or his service, but by the persevering and prevailing
exertions of the opposition party, headed by <i>Pulteney</i>, who
forced him to resign, contrary to the desire or inclination of
the sovereign.&nbsp; His administration has been much censured,
for its systematic corruption.&nbsp; But that corruption never
extended so far as that of certain heaven-born ministers of more
recent times; and it was certainly employed for much better
purposes.&nbsp; His aversion to war, and constant endeavours to
avoid it, cover a multitude of his sins: and it was probably not
so often as most people imagine that this country has been
favoured with better ministers than Sir Robert Walpole.</p>
<p><a name="page909"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 909</span>The
reign of George II. may safely be pronounced, on the whole, one
of the most happy and prosperous in the annals of this
country.&nbsp; The principles of civil and religious liberty were
then favoured at court, and recognized by the sovereign, as what
had seated his family on the throne.&nbsp; Protestant Dissenters
he considered as some of his best friends and most faithful
subjects; nor did his ministers and courtiers ever presume to
treat them with coolness and disrespect, or pretend to entertain
any doubt or suspicion of their loyalty, or their attachment to
the king and constitution, according to the principles laid down
at the revolution.&nbsp; In short, this reign will be
contemplated with no small pleasure by the sons of freedom, as a
period when an open attachment to civil and religious liberty, or
the real rights of man, subjected no one to the suspicion, or
imputation, of being a traitor to his king and country.&nbsp; How
far the same may be said of our situation for the last twenty
years, is a question of which we shall not at present enter upon
the discussion.</p>
<p>One of the first notable acts of our municipality, after the
commencement of this reign, may be presumed to be that of
addressing the throne, by way both of condolence and
congratulation; the former on the death of the late sovereign,
and the latter on the happy accession of his successor.&nbsp; But
as no copy of this address has fallen in our way, we cannot form
any judgment of its tenor or merit: only we are informed that our
cities and boroughs, in general, did then actually send up such
addresses; and it is not to be supposed that the same was <a
name="page910"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 910</span>neglected
or omitted at Lynn, especially as the prime minister himself was
one of its representatives.&nbsp; This address, no doubt, was
sufficiently loyal, but whether or not so eloquent and sublime as
those sent up in the reign of queen Anne, must now be left among
the uncertainties, or, perhaps, even among the inscrutables.</p>
<p>Not long after, or in the course of the autumn of that same
year, as it would seem, the mayor, (Mr. Tho. Allen) according to
one of our manuscript narratives, issued <i>an order to prohibit
the barbers to shave on Sundays</i>; for which we may be pretty
sure his worship had not many thanks from that fraternity.&nbsp;
How far this order was obeyed, or did contribute to the
reformation and benefit of the town, we have not been able to
discover.&nbsp; The wisdom and utility of such measures appear
very questionable, and it is doubtful if they have ever answered
any very good purposes, as they seem to be ill, or not at all,
calculated to convince people of the evil of the conduct or
practices against which they are directed.&nbsp; Some of our
mayors, of more recent days, have taken upon them to issue
similar orders, at the commencement of their mayoralty, but they
have seldom, or never, thought it proper or expedient to enforce
them throughout, or to the end of the year.</p>
<p>Mr John Goodwin, the mayor of the ensuing year, (1728&ndash;,)
distinguished himself, according to the same narrative, in
another way, by setting down a stone-cistern at the end of the
Fish-Shambles, and also endowing one of the Almshouses in broad
Street for one poor <a name="page911"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 911</span>man with two shillings a
week.&mdash;His successor, Mr. Andrew Taylor, distinguished
himself still differently: for, as the same narrative words it,
&ldquo;He did abundance of good, as he thought, by taking away
guns and killing of dogs; but was a friend to the Church, which
he seldom troubled.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is, if we rightly
comprehend the meaning, he was, in talk, a mighty zealot for the
Church, though he seldom would condescend, or deem it worth his
while to honour it with his presence: which, to all thinking and
discerning people, was a sure sign and clear proof that all his
noisy zeal was nothing but mere pretence, to answer some
mercenary or hypocritical end; and but for which he in reality
cared no more for the church than the most heathenish or
irreligious of his neighbours.</p>
<p>How many such churchmen as this Andrew Taylor have been mayors
of this town since his time, it is impossible to say; but that
numbers of them have pretended to be very stanch and zealous for
the Church, while they seldom attended its stated service, or
public worship, is very certain.&nbsp; That there were none of
this description among the present members of the Hall seems much
to be wished; and especially that a truly and christian spirit
towards those of other denominations was more visible and
predominant among them; which yet is suspected not to have been
altogether the case at the formation or establishment of the
Lancastrian school, and in some subsequent circumstances relating
to that event.&nbsp; But this is not the proper place to make
these <a name="page912"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
912</span>matters the subjects of inquiry, investigation, or
animadversion. <a name="citation912"></a><a href="#footnote912"
class="citation">[912]</a></p>
<p>The successor of Taylor, Mr. Charles Harwick, who obtained the
mayoralty in 1730, had most painful scenes to engage his
attention, owing to the most shocking murder of a Mrs Ann Wright,
which had been perpetrated in the town that year, by one George
Smith, aided by Mary Taylor, Mrs Wright&rsquo;s Servant, who had
let him into the house in the dead of the night.&nbsp; For this
black and horrid deed Mary Taylor was burnt alive in the
market-place, and Smith was hanged at the same time, on a gallows
erected, as Mackerell says, seventeen yards distant from the
stake.&nbsp; This happened, it seems, in 1731, the latter part of
Harwick&rsquo;s mayoralty.&nbsp; The superlative atrociousness of
that bloody deed, and the dreadful abandonment, dereliction, or
depravity of mind which it discovered, called, undoubtedly, for
the most exemplary and terrible punishment, in order to deter
those of the like character from the <a name="page913"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 913</span>commission of similar crimes, as
nothing else can be expected to have much effect on such, in
restraining their flagitious propensities.&nbsp; A virtuous
principle, however, after all, is the most powerful and effectual
of all preventives against vicious or criminal excesses, and far
beyond all the terrors of penal laws, or punitive justice.&nbsp;
It is a great pity more care is not taken to instill this
principle as much as possible into the minds of the rising
generations</p>
<p>About the time last mentioned, one <i>John Rudkin</i>, a
member of our municipality, fell under the sore displeasure of
his brethren, and was eventually expelled from among them.&nbsp;
The affair is thus related in the Hall books&mdash;&ldquo;April
26. 1731, Ordered that John Rudkin be discharged from the office
of common Councell man, unless, next Hall-day, he can shew cause
to the contrary; he having disclosed the councells of this
assembly, and the secrets of this corporation, and hath behaved
contemptuously towards the mayor (Charles Harwick Esq. <a
name="citation913"></a><a href="#footnote913"
class="citation">[913]</a>) and other members, justices of this
burgh, and charged some of them with
pyracy.&rdquo;&mdash;again&mdash;&ldquo;June 16. 1731, John
Rudkin&rsquo;s answer being insufficent, he <a
name="page914"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 914</span>was
expelled and discharged from the office of a common
councell.&rdquo;&nbsp; This shews that our corporation, as such,
have <i>counsels</i> and <i>secrets</i>, that are deemed very
improper and criminal to disclose; which seems to look somewhat
dark and suspicious; for if all their proceedings were fair and
just, honestly and solely directed for the public good, what need
could there be to care if the whole world knew all about them? <a
name="citation914"></a><a href="#footnote914"
class="citation">[914]</a>&mdash;Corporations might be beneficial
in their original institution, and in feudal times, to protect
the inhabitants from baronial domination and tyranny; but they
have become long ago (for the most part, at least,) grievous
nuisances, rather than real benefits, to the British public.</p>
<p>At the period we are now reviewing, Lynn was by no means in a
flourishing state, as may be pretty safely concluded from the
following passage in our book of Extracts&mdash;&ldquo;Dec. 23.
1731; Ordered that a memorial be sent to the Representatives in
Parliament, touching the heavy burthen upon them, from the
Land-Tax Act, and from the decrease of traders among them,
praying reliefe.&rdquo;&mdash;Things must have gotten to a sad
pass to <a name="page915"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
915</span>bring our high-minded corporation to so dejected and
supplicating a posture.&nbsp; For sometime previous and
subsequent to the date of the above extract, as the present <a
name="page916"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 916</span>writer has
heard from ancient people who remembered the time, the
<i>indigence</i> of Lynn was a matter of general notoriety; so
that <i>poor Lynn</i> used to be the common appellation of the
town, in the language of the country people.&nbsp; It seems now
to be the prevailing opinion that the late conduct of our rulers,
in subjecting the small houses to taxation, and otherwise so
unconscionably burdening the town, will soon bring things here
again to the same pass, and restore to us the humiliating name of
<i>poor Lynn</i> once more.&nbsp; Our many <i>empty houses</i>
would seem to corroborate this opinion; but we would fain hope
their number will soon decrease, and that some favourable events,
or happy turn of things will prevent such an opinion, or the
fears entertained on this head being realized.</p>
<p>In the times we are now exploring, our mayor was allowed to
confer the freedom of the town, on some one person whom he should
think proper to select for that purpose: hence such notices as
the following occur in our book of Extracts&mdash;&ldquo;Dec. 8.
1732; Rd. Hawkins made ffree, as the mayor&rsquo;s, John
Farthing&rsquo;s ffreeman.&rdquo;&mdash;<a
name="page917"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
917</span>again&mdash;&ldquo;May 8. 1733; Wm. Langley, mariner,
made ffree, upon Andrew Taylor&rsquo;s recommendation, not having
had a ffreeman chosen for his mayoralty, as
accustomed.&rdquo;&mdash;again&mdash;&ldquo;May 23. 1733; Edmd.
Harwick, of Wiggenhall St. Maries, to have his ffreedom upon
recommendation of alderman John Goodwin, he not having had a
ffreeman chosen for his last mayoralty as hath been
accustomed.&rdquo;&mdash;About three months after, however, our
Hall suddenly resolved to discontinue this custom, as appears
from the following passage among our Extracts&mdash;&ldquo;Aug.
29. 1733; Saml. Browne chosen mayor, and to have 150<i>l.</i>
viz. 50<i>l.</i> for the better carrying on the mayoralty;
50<i>l.</i> for the entertainment on Michaelmas Day; and
50<i>l.</i> on St. John&rsquo;s Day&rdquo;&mdash;Then it is
added&mdash;&ldquo;And that <i>no succeeding mayor have the
liberty of naming</i>, <i>or making a ffreeman</i>, <i>as his
ffreeman</i>, <i>for the future</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But they did
not long adhere to this order, or resolution, or persist in so
self-denying a course, as we find by another note among the same
Extracts, which is expressed thus&mdash;&ldquo;May 22. 1739; The
revd. Mr. Edmd. Keene had his ffreedom gratis, <i>as his
father&rsquo;s ffreeman</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation917"></a><a
href="#footnote917" class="citation">[917]</a>&nbsp; Whether or
not it was very wise to discontinue this custom, or afterwards to
revive it, after it had been so expressly and formally abolished,
we will not now stop to inquire, but shall here close this
section.</p>

<p>About the time of which we have been speaking, our Corporation
had a great suit in Chancery with one of their own principal
members; and however justifiable or unjustifiable it might be, a
falling out among brethren must be allowed to be, at any time and
on any occasion, a very unpleasant occurrence.&nbsp; Our
knowledge of this unlovely affair is derived from the following
luminous passage in our book of Extracts&mdash;&ldquo;Dec. 22.
1738; Whereas there was lately a suit depending in Chancery
between the mayor and burgesses and Robt. Britiffe Esq. their
trustee, against alderman Thomas Allen, (which was the 7th.&nbsp;
Octr. 1738, agreed that Mr. Serjeant Urlin, Chas. Clarke Esq. and
Mr. Tho. Nutting be appointed Referees to arbitrate) for the
recovery of the ancient customary payment of 1<i>d.</i> per
quarter for corn sold by the said Tho. Allen, upon contracts made
by him with other merchants, not being freemen, for shipping such
corn at a price certain, clear of all charges.&nbsp; Said Mr.
Allen hath agreed to pay not only all the arrears for all corn he
shipped off out of this port, where the same was not really his
own risque and adventure, but in all future times to pay the said
<a name="page919"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 919</span>dues for
all corn which he shall contract for and sell to any persons not
being freemen of the said borough, which shall be exported out of
the said borough by water.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this suit the
corporation evidently got the better of their opponent; but this
is far from having been invariably the case in all their
law-suits, as has before appeared in the course of this work.</p>
<p>The year 1741 was rendered very remarkable and memorable in
this town and country, on account of a violent storm, or
hurricane, which then happened, and did great damage to the
churches and other buildings.&nbsp; It arose on the 8th of
September O. S. and blew down the spires of St. Nicholas&rsquo;
chapel, and St. Margaret&rsquo;s Church, and demolished a great
part of the body of the latter.&nbsp; The following memoranda,
written at that period, will further describe the awful effects
of this disastrous visitation.&nbsp; Among our Extracts, so often
quoted, it is noted as follows under the date of Sept. 9. 1741;
&ldquo;The Hurrycane yesterday blew down the spire and body of
St. Margaret&rsquo;s Church; also the spire of St.
Nicholas&rsquo;s Chappell.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in another place, but
of the same date, it is thus noted&mdash;&ldquo;That whereas the
Hurricane yesterday blew down St. Margaret&rsquo;s spire and part
of the Church, application be made to Sir Robert Walpole to
procure ane act of parliament for rebuilding the
same.&rdquo;&nbsp; But a more particular account of the effects
of this furious tempest we have found written on a blank leaf, at
the end of a copy of the history of the great storm in
1703.&nbsp; It is in the handwriting of a Mr. <a
name="page920"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 920</span><i>Tho.
Peirson</i>, a clergyman, if we are not mistaken, whose property
the book probably was, and it runs as follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;M E M.&nbsp; That on Tuesday 8. Sept. 1741,
about 20 minutes after 12 at noon, was a most violent storm of
wind and rain, which blew down St. Margarett&rsquo;s Church
Steeple and St. Nicholas at Lynn Regis, with the Weather-cock,
&amp;c. of All-Hallows Church in South Lynn, <a
name="citation920"></a><a href="#footnote920"
class="citation">[920]</a> Norfolk.&nbsp; Also the great West
gabble-end, with a very large stack of chimneys, and the
Weather-Hand of Middleton-Hall&mdash;And a great barn belonging
to Henry Whiteman&rsquo;s Farm at Tilney, with a small barn
belonging to Thos.&nbsp; Cricks Farm at Outwell, in the Isle of
Ely, the property of Me.&mdash;Besides divers other buildings in
Marshland; and great damage was done to the Timber and others
Trees in the country about Lynn and Downham.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Ita Testor</i>.&nbsp; <i>Tho:
Peirson</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The damages sustained here from this storm were all in time
repaired: those of St. Margaret&rsquo;s Church, it seems, by
virtue of an act of parliament.&nbsp; One of our MS. narratives
informs us that the rebuilding of that church was begun in 1742,
during the mayoralty of Edward Everard, and completed in 1747,
during that of Walter Robertson; so that it appears to have been
<a name="page921"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 921</span>about
five years in rebuilding.&nbsp; But the new, or present church,
like Ezra and Nehemiah&rsquo;s new temple at Jerusalem, is said
to be much inferior to the former, in point of dimension, as well
as beauty and magnificence.&nbsp; It may be supposed however,
that the <i>pardons</i> or <i>indulgences</i> offered to the
contributors towards the old edifice, procured ampler funds for
its completion than the <i>act of parliament</i> that was
obtained for completing the new.</p>
<p>It would seem as if our very river and harbour had not
entirely escaped the effects of that storm, and even that it did,
or occasioned some very material damage to them; at least, there
were great complaints made just after, of the bad and very
perilous state to which they were then reduced.&nbsp; This will
appear from the following passage, extracted from the Town
Records&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sept. 9. 1741 agreed that the defences in
sundry places of the Harbour are become insufficient to confine
the fflux and reflux of the Tide, so that the Port and Harbour
will soon be lost&mdash;That the two points of land on the east
and west side of the river about a mile below the town are worn
away by the rage of the sea, so that Marshland on one hand, and
Gaywood and Wooton and all the low-lands thereabouts on the
other, are in danger of being swallowed up by the sea&mdash;That,
to guard against the flux and reflux, Piers are conceived to be
absolutely necessary to be placed both above and below Lynn, for
the preservation of the Town as well as the Port and
Harbour.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page922"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
922</span>Shortly after another meeting was held at the Hall on
the same occasion; which is thus noticed in the same
Extracts&mdash;&ldquo;Octr. 15. 1741, Sir John Turner, bart. is
desired to write to Sir Robert Walpole, to recommend a Surveyor
to view the Harbour, and to draw a report thereof, in order to
have the same laid before parliament.&rdquo;&mdash;Three weeks
after, the result of this application to the minister is thus
announced&mdash;&ldquo;Nov. 5th.&nbsp; Sir John Turner acquainted
that he had received a Letter from Sir Robt. Walpole,
recommending Mr. Roswell, then at Hull, to survey the Harbour;
and he is accepted and approved of to be Surveyor, and B. Nuthall
Esq. or his Deputy, Mr. Recorder, aldermen Goodwin, Allen,
Farthing, Bagge&mdash;Mr. Hulton, Everard, Langley, or any five
or more to be a committee to prepare instructions for
him.&rdquo;&mdash;again&mdash;&ldquo;Dec. 14. 1741; Ordered
21<i>l.</i> to be presented to Mr. Rodwell [<i>so the name is
spelt here</i>:] for his trouble and advice in matters relating
to the Harbour and South
Marsh.&rdquo;&mdash;Furthermore&mdash;&ldquo;Febr. 24
1741&ndash;2;&mdash;Mr. Wm. Reynolds presented his report
touching his survey of the Harbour, together with ane estimate of
the charges in the erecting of two Piers which he proposes for
the restoration and preservation thereof, which is approved
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards we hear no more of this business, for nine months
or more.&nbsp; Then we find it further noticed as
follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Novr. 29th. 1742; Ordered that application
be made to parliament for the preservation of the channel and
harbour of this Port and Borough, which are in danger of being
lost.&mdash;The schemes of Mr Rosewell <a
name="page923"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 923</span>and Mr.
Reynolds being read and approved of, it is agreed that the same
be carryed into execution, and this House hath agreed to resolve
itselfe into a Committee of the whole House, to consider of ways
and means for raising moneys, by laying such rates and duties on
goods and merchandizes imported into, and exported out of this
Port, or by such other ways as they shall think proper for the
effectuall carrying those schemes into execution, for preserving
the channel and harbour aforesaid and rendring the same usefull
and safe for navigation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What beneficial effects resulted from the above measures we
have not been able to discover.&nbsp; Nor do our Extracts afford
us any further information relating to the subject, except what
is suggested in the following passage&mdash;&ldquo;Dec. 19. 1744;
A Committee [was appointed] to view the state of the banks, in
Gaywood and Wooton, lying against the sea&mdash;and to view the
breach made in the South Marsh bank, by the rageing tides, and
enquire if the corporation may desert the lands lying upon the
banks, and whether by such desertion the corporation will be
discharged from the repairing said banks.&rdquo;&mdash;This
passage discovers more selfishness than public spirit.&nbsp; They
seemed disposed to let the banks remain unrepaired, and take no
further care of them, whatever might be the consequence to the
country, provided they could be sure it might be done with
perfect safety, or without any pecuniary risk to
themselves.&nbsp; This is in the true corporation character.</p>
<p><a name="page924"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 924</span>The
next year (1745) was very memorably distinguished by the
rebellion, which then broke out in Scotland in favour of the
pretender, or the son of James II.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On the 6th of August this year some notices
having been communicated to the government of such an attempt,
aided by the French Court, a proclamation was published, offering
a reward of 30,000<i>l.</i> for apprehending and securing the
eldest son of the pretender, in case he should land, or attempt
to land, in any of his majesty&rsquo;s dominions.&nbsp; On the
17th. an account arrived, that several persons had landed between
the islands of <i>Mull</i> and <i>Skie</i>, one of whom it was
supposed was the pretender&rsquo;s Son.&nbsp; On September 5, his
majesty sent notice to the lord mayor of London, that the
pretender&rsquo;s eldest son had landed in Scotland, and that
several persons had assembled there and broke out into open
rebellion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon after advice arrived, that the rebels had marched
Southward.&nbsp; On the 13th. they passed the Forth, five miles
above Stirling, and on the 17th. took possession of the city of
Edinburgh.&nbsp; By that time general <i>Cope</i> with his army
landed at Dunbar, and began to march towards that capital.&nbsp;
The rebels did not wait to be attacked by him, but came out to
meet him, and on the 21st. at daybreak, they attacked him at
<i>Preston Pans</i>, seven miles east of Edinburgh, and totally
defeated him, making most of his infantry prisoners.&nbsp; The
dragoons made their escape to <i>Berwick</i>, with little loss,
save that of the brave <i>Colonel Gardiner</i>.&nbsp; These
advantages on the side of the rebels spread a general <a
name="page925"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
925</span>consternation throughout the kingdom; but all ranks and
orders, as we are told, vied with each other in displaying their
loyalty, and abhorrence of this unnatural rebellion.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many associations were now entered into for the support of his
majesty&rsquo;s crown and dignity, and the constitution in church
and state.&nbsp; A large body of <i>British</i>, <i>Dutch</i>,
and <i>Hessian</i> troops were brought over from Flanders: and
the success of the rebellion, and dread of a threatened invasion
from France, having caused a great run upon the Bank, 1100
merchants and eminent tradesmen met, and subscribed their names
to an agreement, not to refuse bank-notes in any payment to be
made to them.&mdash;On Oct. 18. the duke of Cumberland arrived
from Flanders, and set out on Nov. 26. to take upon him the
command of the army, then on its march into Lancashire.&nbsp; For
the rebels, having increased to 8,000, had left <i>Edinburgh</i>,
on October 26, and on November 15. the city of <i>Carlisle</i>
was surrendered to them.&nbsp; On the 24th. without any
molestation, they arrived at <i>Lancaster</i>, and on the 29th.
took possession of <i>Manchester</i>, where they formed into a
regiment those who had joined them in England.&nbsp; In the
beginning of December they left <i>Manchester</i> and advanced to
<i>Congleton</i>, as if they intended to meet and engage the Duke
of Cumberland, whose advanced guard was then at
<i>Newcastle-under-Line</i>.&nbsp; But they suddenly turned off
to the left, and marched into <i>Derbyshire</i>, seeming to have
an intention to slip by the duke, and take their way directly to
London.</p>
<p><a name="page926"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 926</span>When
this news reached the metropolis it occasioned the greatest
consternation imaginable; the run upon the Bank and depression of
the public Funds became very great and alarming; but recourse was
immediately had to such measures as were thought most proper
towards remedying those evils, and frustrating the supposed
intention of the dreaded enemy.&nbsp; On the 4th. of December,
the rebels entered the town of <i>Derby</i>, and soon, after
contrary to expectation, began to retreat northward by the rout
they came.&nbsp; Such was the panic with which the nation was
then seized, that it was thought if they had proceeded straight
to London, they might have entered and mastered it with little or
no opposition.&nbsp; There were then no bands of armed citizens,
as at some other periods; and the troops stationed there and
thereabout, were now ordered to march and form a camp upon
<i>Finchley-common</i>: but had the rebels appeared, they would
probably have behaved no better than their brethren had done at
<i>Preston Pans and Falkirk</i>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the general panic and alarm, as might be
supposed, extended even to Lynn, and produced here very
remarkable and whimsical effects.&nbsp; No sooner was it known
that the rebels were at <i>Derby</i>, than it was concluded, by
our wise men, that they certainly meant to visit this town, in
their way to the metropolis.&nbsp; And as it was judged that they
would attempt to enter at the South-Gate, or that the town was
most vulnerable on that side, it was deemed necessary to
strengthen that part by constructing there some new
outworks.&nbsp; In <a name="page927"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
927</span>this service great numbers of the inhabitants
cheerfully engaged.&nbsp; The late Mr. <i>Philip Case</i> was
then mayor.&nbsp; His worship and the whole corporate body turned
out on this occasion, and took their places among the numerous
workmen, with spades, shovels, and pickaxes in their hands,
assisting with all their might towards the completion of what was
supposed so necessary a measure for the effectual defence and
preservation of the town.</p>
<p>But these extraordinary exertions of our patriotic townsmen
did not long continue, being soon rendered unnecessary, by the
arrival of undoubted intelligence, that the rebels had no
immediate design upon these parts, and were actually in full
retreat towards Scotland.&nbsp; All our fear and consternation
now vanished, of course; the project for fortifying the town was
instantly relinquished; every thing, in short, reverted to its
usual channel, and resumed its former undisturbed and tranquil
appearance.&nbsp; But, if our traditional information may be
relied upon, there occurred here, during the bustling and
alarming interval, some very queer and ludicrous incidents, which
some of our ancient townsmen often relate, with much pleasantry
and good humour, as what would seem less creditable to the
wisdom, the sagacity, and the fortitude of their good forefathers
of that period, than to their loyalty, or their patriotism. <a
name="citation927"></a><a href="#footnote927"
class="citation">[927]</a></p>
<p><a name="page928"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 928</span>The
rebellion existed for several months after its dread had ceased
to be felt in this town.&nbsp; As soon as the duke got notice of
the retreat of the rebels, he set out in pursuit of them, with
all the horse in his army, and about a thousand foot soldiers
mounted on horseback.&nbsp; Marshal <i>Wade</i> also, who
commanded a separate corps, detached a considerable body of
cavalry, under general <i>Oglethorpe</i> for the same
purpose.&nbsp; On December 18th. the duke came up with the rear
of the rebels at <i>Clifton</i>, in Northumberland, where he
obtained some advantage over them.&nbsp; On the 30th. he retook
<i>Carlisle</i>, after a siege of nine days, making the garrison
prisoners.&nbsp; Their main army had by that time reached
Scotland, to which kingdom the rebellion was thenceforth entirely
confined till its final suppression after the battle of
<i>Culloden</i>.</p>
<p>On Jan. 5, 1746, the duke returned to St. James&rsquo;s; and
on the 17th. of that month, the rebels defeated the king&rsquo;s
forces commanded by general <i>Hawley</i>, near <a
name="page929"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
929</span><i>Falkirk</i>, though the latter were much superior in
numbers.&nbsp; Upon this misfortune, it was thought expedient the
duke should take upon him the command of the army in
Scotland.&nbsp; He accordingly left London for that purpose, and
arrived at Edinburgh on the 30th. of that month.&nbsp; The
rebels, who had laid siege to the castle of <i>Stirling</i>, then
retreated, and the duke followed them, as fast as the severity of
the season and badness of the roads would permit, and arrived at
<i>Aberdeen</i> on the 27th of February.&nbsp; Meantime the
rebels reduced the Castle of <i>Inverness</i> and Fort
<i>Augustus</i>, and laid siege also to Fort <i>William</i>, and
<i>Blair</i> Castle, of Athol, but failed in both those
attempts.&nbsp; On the 8th. of April the duke left
<i>Aberdeen</i>, and on the 14th. arrived at <i>Nairn</i>; and
being there assured that the rebels were encamped at
<i>Culloden</i> House, near <i>Inverness</i>, he rested the whole
of the 15th. at <i>Nairn</i>, to refresh his men.&nbsp; That
night the rebels marched, with intent to attack him before
daylight; but failed, through some mismanagement; whereupon they
returned to <i>Culloden</i>, resolving, in that station, to wait
for their pursuers.</p>
<p>The duke, on the 16th. left <i>Nairn</i>, between 4 and 5 in
the morning; and at two in the afternoon the engagement
began.&nbsp; The rebels obtained some advantage at first, but
were soon thrown into confusion and totally defeated, with great
slaughter, and circumstances of unusual barbarity, which exposed
the duke to much censure, especially from our northern
countrymen, and procured him the reproachful appellation of the
<i>bloody butcher</i>.&nbsp; <a name="page930"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 930</span>Others, however, hailed him as the
saviour of the country, and a pattern of every patriotic and
princely excellence; and he ever after possessed, especially in
these southern parts, great and unrivalled popularity.&nbsp; The
battle of Culloden put an end to every chance or hope of
restoring the Stuart family, and the evils of rebellion and civil
war have never since been experienced in this island.</p>
<p>Of the numerous prisoners taken in the course of the
rebellion, some were pardoned, and a considerable number
executed, but a far greater number of them were transported to
America, where they largely contributed, by their sobriety and
industry, to the increasing population and prosperity of that
country.&nbsp; The duke continued in Scotland sometime after the
battle of <i>Culloden</i>, when some further severities were
exercised, but whether just and wholesome, or not, we will not
now take upon us to pronounce.&nbsp; Agreeably with those
severities, an act passed that same year for <i>disarming</i> the
Highlanders, and restraining the use of the Highland
<i>dress</i>; which must have reduced those people to a must
humiliating and degrading situation.&nbsp; A more liberal and
enlightened policy, towards that country, was adopted by our
government some years after, under the administration of the
elder <i>Pitt</i>: since which time the Scots have ranked
invariably among the most loyal and zealous of the adherents or
subjects of the House of Hanover.&nbsp; A similar policy adopted
towards <i>Ireland</i> would, no doubt, produce similar effects
there, and place that whole nation among the most estimable
subject of the <a name="page931"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
931</span>British empire.&nbsp; But it is to be feared that we
shall not be very soon blessed with a ministry endowed with so
much virtue, or so much wisdom.</p>
<p>From the termination of the rebellion to the time of the
king&rsquo;s death, the affairs of the nation went on
prosperously, as did also those of this town.&nbsp; The years
1747 and 1748 were here much distinguished by the uncommon number
of persons who were then made free <i>gratis</i>&mdash;Such as
Joseph Tayler M.D.&nbsp; John Wilson Esq.&nbsp; Chas. Townshend
Esq.&nbsp; Rd. Hammond Esq.&nbsp; Rev. Wm. Everard; Rev. Dr. Edm.
Pyle; Rev. Robt. Hammond; Robt. Hammond Esq.&nbsp; John Nuthall
Esq.&nbsp; Chas: Cooper Morely; John Partridge gent.&nbsp; John
Davis Esq.&nbsp; Rev. John Daville, and Rev. Chas.
Phelps.&mdash;Such a batch of new burgesses must, no doubt, have
greatly augmented the consequence and respectability of the
town.</p>
<p>The year 1749, or, at least, the mayoralty that began that
year, exhibited here a most sad catastrophe, attended with most
shocking circumstances.&nbsp; It was the condemnation and
execution of one <i>Charles Holditch</i>, for burglary in his own
father&rsquo;s house, and an attempt to murder the old man in his
bed, which he was prevented from perpetrating by a child, who was
then in bed with the old man.&nbsp; This was certainly an
instance of enormous and almost unexampled depravity; and may,
perhaps, be considered as an indication of the wretched state of
morals then in this town among the common people.&nbsp; The
clergy, as it is too often the case, cared, probably, little or
nothing about instructing the <a name="page932"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 932</span>lower orders; and there were here
then but few dissenters to supply the lack of service, or
deficiencies of the established ministry.</p>
<p>In 1751, or during the mayoralty which then commenced, another
shocking scene occurred here, which is thus related in one of our
MS. narratives&mdash;&ldquo;This year <i>Wm. Chaplain</i> was
hang&rsquo;d on a gibbet upon South-Lynn Common, for the
murdering of <i>Mary Gafferson</i>&mdash;being the first ever
known to be hung in chains in this town.&rdquo;&nbsp; This seems
to corroborate what was said before, of the wretched state of
morals here then among the lower orders of the community.&nbsp;
And the present writer can easily conceive, and is very confident
that such must have been then the case, from what he knows it to
have been somewhat more than twenty years after, (or 35 years
ago,) when he first came to reside here.&nbsp; In point of
morals, manners, and outward decency, the town is much improved
since that period; and yet there is much room still for further
improvement.&nbsp; The change for the better which has already
taken place, and which is hoped to be still in its progress, must
be ascribed partly to the superior character of the church
ministry here of late years, and partly to the unwearied
exertions of the methodists and our other dissenters: <a
name="citation932"></a><a href="#footnote932"
class="citation">[932]</a> and as the numbers of those who have
<a name="page933"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 933</span>been
reformed and converted from their former rudeness and heathenism
have already much increased, and are still increasing, it may be
hoped that the influence of their example will also increase in
equal proportion, till our whole population becomes thoroughly
reformed, civilized, and enlightened.</p>
<p>Among the most memorable and important of the recorded acts of
our municipality in 1751, are to be reckoned the choosing of
<i>Dr. Joseph Tayler</i>, a <i>physician</i>, into the
common-council, and enrolling the name of our respected townsman,
<i>Thomas Day Esq.</i> among our free burgesses.&nbsp; From that
time nothing worth notice occurs till 1755, when the following
passage is noted among our Extracts&mdash;&ldquo;1755, July
7th.&nbsp; Ordered that his Majesties grant 8th May 1755, to
Henry Partridge Esq. Recorder, in trust for the Mayor and
Burgesses, of the fourth part of the Tollbooth and Tolls in the
Village and Port of Lynn, and the Tolls for weighing Wool,
mensuration, and Love Copp, and also the Water of Wiggenhall and
office of Bailif there, with the profits of Courts, &amp;c. and
also the office of gauger in the Village and Port afforesaid, and
the profits of the fyshery of the said waters, &amp;c. to hold
for 31 years from Lady Day 1755, and expires at Lady Day 1786, to
be laid up in the Treasury.&rdquo;&mdash;These advantages seem to
have been conferred by the corporation on the Recorder of that
day, in consideration of the slenderness of the Salary annexed to
his office.&nbsp; Whether there be <a name="page934"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 934</span>any similar appendage to the Salary
of the present Recorder, we are unable to say.&mdash;Under the
same year the following note occurs&mdash;&ldquo;August 27.&nbsp;
The Mayor&rsquo;s Sallary to be 100<i>l.</i> from Michaelmas
next.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seems to have been before unfixed.&nbsp; It
surely ought to be now 300<i>l.</i> at least.&nbsp; Yet we cannot
find that to be the case.</p>
<p>Nothing of any consequence appear to have occurred here during
the remainder of this reign.&nbsp; The last recorded acts of our
municipality before the expiration of this period, as far as we
can find, are the following&mdash;&ldquo;August 29. 1760, Mr. Th.
Day chosen Common-Councell-man&mdash;Honourable Geo. Townshend
ffree gratis.&rdquo;&mdash;again&mdash;&ldquo;Sept. 29.&nbsp; The
Mayor for the time being to be indemnifyed from all charges,
&amp;c. occasioned thro&rsquo; any neglects of the Goaler or
Serjeants at Mace.&rdquo;&nbsp; The king died on the 25th. of
October that same year, at Kensington, in the 77th. year of his
age, and the 34th. of his reign, the close of which was
distinguished by what has been generally deemed very glorious
events, and a most happy harmony among his subjects.</p>
<p>Before we close this section and take our final leave of
George II, some notice may and ought to be taken of a
circumstance, the most important and interesting, perhaps, in its
effects, or consequences, of any that occurred in that reign: and
that is, the <i>origin of methodism</i>, or of that popular
religious sect, whose votaries or constituents are denominated
<i>methodists</i>, and which is now become the most numerous body
of protestant dissenters in the British dominions.&nbsp; Their
numbers and their influence <a name="page935"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 935</span>are now so great, and so rapidly
increasing, as to have evidently excited no small alarm among our
higher powers, in church and state, and even among the
<i>Wilberforce party</i>, or that class of churchmen which
assumes or bears the name of <i>evangelical</i>; <a
name="citation935"></a><a href="#footnote935"
class="citation">[935]</a> as we learn from the late memorable
Bill of Lord <i>Sidmouth</i>, together with certain circumstances
which it was the means of bringing to light.</p>
<p>This Sect, like most others, sprang from a small
beginning.&nbsp; Its founders were a few young men of the
university of Oxford, of the names of Morgan, John and Charles
Wesley, Kirkman, Ingham, James Harvey, George Whitefield,
&amp;c.&nbsp; A young gentleman of <i>Christ Church</i> named
them <i>methodists</i>, in allusion to some ancient physicians,
so called.&nbsp; Others denominated them the <i>Holy Club</i>;
but this name soon died away; whereas the other remained, and
became permanent; and the sect is known and distinguished by it
to this day.&nbsp; Oxford could not long contain, or retain these
birds of paradise.&nbsp; They soon got out of the shell, quitted
the nest and flew abroad; and by the time of the birth of our
present sovereign, their voice was heard, and much listened to,
in London, and a great many other places.&nbsp; Since that time
they have been ever on the increase, more or less; <a
name="page936"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 936</span>and of late
years prodigiously so; which may account for the doubts and fears
entertained in certain quarters, as to the consequence.</p>
<p><i>John Wesley</i> and <i>George Whitefield</i> being by far
the most active and eloquent of the original methodists, soon
came to be looked upon as the oracles, or proper chiefs and
leaders of the sect.&nbsp; They went on harmoniously for
sometime; but, after a while, these extraordinary men imbibed
opposite opinions, and became attached to different creeds.&nbsp;
Wesley declared himself an <i>arminian</i>, and Whitefield a
<i>calvinist</i>; which occasioned a separation among their
followers, and produced two distinct sects, under the expressive
denominations of <i>Wesleyan</i> or <i>arminian methodists</i>,
<a name="citation936"></a><a href="#footnote936"
class="citation">[936]</a> and <i>Whitefieldian</i> or
<i>calvinian methodistis</i>.&nbsp; But the worst of it was, that
from being warm and sworn friends, they now became bitter and
deadly foes, and declared open war against each other, which was
carried on with unabated rancour for many years, to the no small
amusement and gratification of the enemies of both parties, and
the just and lasting reproach of their own arrogant pretensions
to superior goodness and sanctity.</p>
<p>Nothing could be more uncharitable, illiberal, and unchristian
than the behaviour of these two sister sects, for many years,
towards each other.&nbsp; The champions <a
name="page937"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 937</span>on both
sides generally treated their opponents as the vilest miscreants
and reprobates; and such enemies of God and man as had scarcely
any chance of salvation while they retained their professed and
respective principles.&nbsp; At length their bitter animosities
subsided, and the fierce contest ceased: a sort of alliance took
place between them; and ever since the utmost efforts of their
malevolence, and whole energy of their intolerance have been
employed in calumniating and persecuting other religionists,
called <i>unitarians</i>, <i>universalists</i>, &amp;c. whom they
now treat in a manner much like that in which they formerly
treated each other.&nbsp; This is a remarkable circumstance,
which we ought not to lose sight of, as it will enable us to form
a proper estimate of the respect that is due to the hostile and
clamorous conduct of these domineering sects towards those
illfated religionists who are, at this present time, the chief
objects of their jealousy, their malevolence, and their
opposition.</p>
<p>At the commencement of the present reign this sect was become
very considerable among the religious denominations of this
kingdom; and it has been ever since rapidly increasing, so as to
cause no small alarm in some quarters.&nbsp; At present, it seems
to be the prevailing opinion that methodism will soon acquire
unrivalled preponderance among us, and perhaps become, at last,
and at no very distant period, the established religion of
England. <a name="citation937"></a><a href="#footnote937"
class="citation">[937]</a>&nbsp; Should it so happen, it is to be
hoped <a name="page938"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
938</span>that it will previously undergo a kind of
<i>regeneration</i>, so as to prove (among other things) less
illiberal and intolerant than it is at present; otherwise neither
the dissenting sects, nor the nation at large will have any
mighty cause to congratulate themselves on the
occasion.&mdash;But we will dwell no longer upon this subject at
present, as we may have occasion to resume it in another part of
the work.&mdash;Having now made our way to the year 1760 and the
commencement of the present reign, we shall here close this long
section.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> VIII.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Accession of George III&mdash;flattering
aspect of British affairs at that period&mdash;general
expectation then of the commencement or approach of halcyon days
and a golden age&mdash;those expectations have not been yet
realized&mdash;on the contrary</i>, <i>the nation has witnessed
and experienced a very different order or state of
things</i>&mdash;<i>Views of the affairs of Lynn for the first
twenty years of this reign</i>.</p>
<p>Upon the demise of the late king, he was succeeded by his
grandson the prince of Wales, under the name of <a
name="page939"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 939</span><i>George
the third</i>; who was immediately proclaimed, with the usual
ceremonies, when he made a most gracious declaration to his
privy-council, which gave great satisfaction, and was much
applauded.&nbsp; On the 8th of September 1761 he was married to
the princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg Strelitz, and on the 22nd.
of the same month their majesties were crowned at Westminster
Abbey.&nbsp; The issue of this marriage is more numerous than
that of any of our former sovereigns; at least, for many ages
past; so that it is not likely that there will happen here soon
any dispute about the regal succession.</p>
<p>No prince ever ascended the throne of these realms more with
the approbation, or to the satisfaction of the nation at large
than did George III; nor do we know of any other of our
sovereigns at whose accession there was so fair and bright a
prospect of a happy and glorious reign.&nbsp; The people
universally expected it, and thought they had a right so to do,
on account of that proud and unrivalled preeminence which the
nation had lately acquired among the powers of Europe, and of the
world.&nbsp; In this expectation, however, we have been
disappointed; for those fond and sanguine hopes which were once
so confidently entertained and cherished have never yet been
realized; and it is not very likely now that they ever
will.&nbsp; We live at a most eventful period, so that it is no
great wonder that our disasters and disappointments were not
foreseen fifty years ago.</p>
<p>Our miscarriages have been so numerous, and the
wrongheadedness of our Statesmen and public functionaries <a
name="page940"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 940</span>so
notorious, as to give no small countenance, if not entirely to
justify, the opinion of those who assert that the Evil Genius of
Britain has presided in its councils, and has had the sole
direction of its affairs, with very few exceptions, for the last
fifty years, at least.&nbsp; Strong symptoms of political
wrongheadedness and ministerial depravity appeared as early as
the time when the machine of government was committed to the
management of lord Bute, with his coadjutors and
underlings.&nbsp; The affair of general warrants, and the project
for taxing America, rendered those symptoms still more visible
and alarming, while our persisting in our dispute with the
Colonists, and undertaking to answer their arguments and silence
their complaints by the mouth of our cannon, demonstrated our
despotic character and boundless infatuation, and prepared the
world to behold, without surprise, the folly and insanity of our
subsequent projects and undertakings.</p>
<p>It was hoped by many that the disastrous result of the
American war would have brought us to our senses.&nbsp; But it
did not so happen.&nbsp; Our subsequent conduct has been for the
most part as unwise and senseless as ever it was during our
dispute and war with America.&nbsp; Had we been capable of
serious reflection, the American war would, doubtless, have
brought us to it.&nbsp; Dear-bought experience is said to have
been of great use to some people; but it has been in this case
quite useless to us; though experience has seldom been more
dearly bought than that which Britain has acquired by the
American war.&nbsp; In fact, it does not seem that experience is
of so <a name="page941"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
941</span>much use to mankind, as is generally supposed; not
because it is useless in itself, or incapable of making us wiser,
but because most people are no way disposed to avail themselves
of its aid, and choose to follow their passions rather than their
reason.&nbsp; They seemingly hate to look back and recollect
former mischances, or to profit by past experience.&nbsp; Both
the past and the future appear to be by them equally
disregarded.&nbsp; The present employs all their thoughts; and
whatsoever errors they may have committed, or inconvenience
experienced on that account, little care is generally taken to
guard against their repetition or recurrence.&nbsp; Such is the
case with nations as well as individuals.&nbsp; So the world
goes: and thus, in spite of past experience, every age performs
its own folly, and re-acts or repeats the absurdities and crimes
of its predecessors.</p>
<p>Sometimes the national errors and follies of one age appear to
exceed those of the preceding age, and even of many preceding
ages.&nbsp; This has been thought applicable to the present
period.&nbsp; Our domestic grievances from different
administrations, for the last fifty years, our treatment of the
<i>Caribbs of St. Vincent</i>, <a name="citation941"></a><a
href="#footnote941" class="citation">[941]</a> together with our
American and subsequent wars, and also the affair of the
<i>Spanish frigates</i>, and of <i>Copenhagen</i>, seem to exceed
<i>tenfold</i> all our internal grievances and public ministerial
enormities for the preceding fifty, or even <i>seventy</i>
years.&nbsp; What addition will be made to this catalogue during
the remainder of this reign, it is impossible to foresee; but it
is to be hoped that things ere <a name="page942"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 942</span>long will take a more favourable
turn, as it is surely high time they should.</p>
<p>These observations we shall now conclude, in the words of one
of the historians of this reign&mdash;&ldquo;In comparing (says
he) the brilliant and auspicious commencement of the reign of the
present monarch with the dark and dreadful scenes which ensued
(and, it is painful to add, with those which at [this] advanced
period seem yet impending) the imagination is led forcibly to
advert to the sublime symbolical representations introduced by a
poet of the highest order, Mr. Gray, in his celebrated Ode of
<i>The Bard</i>, in allusion to the catastrophe terminating the
reign of Richard II. in the splendor of its opening dawn, and its
subsequent <i>fatal indiscretions</i>, bearing no very distant
analogy to the present. <a name="citation942"></a><a
href="#footnote942" class="citation">[942]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fair laughs the morn, and
soft the Zephyr blows;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While proudly riding o&rsquo;er the azure realm<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In gallant trim the gilded vessel goes;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Youth at the prow, and Pleasure at the helm;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Regardless of the sweeping whirlwind&rsquo;s
sway.<br />
That hush&rsquo;d in grim repose expects his evening
prey.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the transactions and occurrences that constitute the
history of Lynn for the first twenty years of this reign we know
of none that can be deemed very interesting or important.&nbsp;
Some of them, however, are no less so than many of those that
have been already related, and therefore cannot be silently
passed over, or omitted, without departing from the plan which
has been hitherto pursued.&nbsp; In regard to this period, as
well as the preceding ones, it is much to be wished we could
throw some <a name="page943"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
943</span>further light on the internal state of the town, or
what relates to the domestic character, social habits, or lives
and manners of the inhabitants.&nbsp; Here, however, our
materials have always proved very scanty; and the same has been
generally the case with other historical writers.&nbsp; This
work, accordingly, often appears as a history of the
<i>corporation</i>; rather than of the town at large, or of the
whole community; because our materials relate chiefly to that
chartered body, placing all the rest far in the back ground, and
often quite out of sight.&nbsp; This is to be regretted.</p>
<p>Among the memorable events which took place at Lynn about, or
soon after the commencement of this reign, was the falling of the
tower or steeple of South Lynn church.&nbsp; This happened,
according to one of our MS. narratives, during the second
mayoralty of Walter Robertson, which commenced at Michaelmas
1761.&nbsp; This is said to have been a strong square tower,
about 82 feet high, with stone battlements; having thereon a
shaft and vane 30 feet high.&nbsp; It had in it also, as Parkin
says, five tuneable bells: and it appears to have in its fall
demolished a good part of the west end of the church.&nbsp; The
damage, as to the church, was soon repaired, but the tower was
never afterwards rebuilt.&nbsp; South Lynn makes now a much
humbler appearance than it did in former days, when it was
adorned with two lofty towers; that which we have now mentioned,
and that of the Carmelite convent, which stood a little way off,
adjoining to that convent, in what is now <a
name="page944"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 944</span>called
<i>The Friars</i>.&nbsp; This tower is said to have fallen in
1690: so that the tower of the parish Church stood above 130
years longer; owing, perhaps, to its being kept in better repair;
though it may be supposed to have been, like the other, neglected
afterwards.</p>
<p>Much about the time of which we have been speaking, another
remarkable event occurred within our municipal or admiralty
jurisdiction.&nbsp; This was the taking of a large <i>whale</i>,
near <i>Beverley creek</i>, according to one account, or near
<i>Darsingham</i>, according to the <i>Norfolk Remembrancer</i>;
which further says, that it was 56 feet 9 inches long, and 34
feet 4 inches in girth; and moreover, that it was taken on the
27th. of March 1762.&nbsp; If we are not mistaken there was some
dispute about it between our mayor of that time and Mr. Styleman,
or some other gentleman of the vicinity of the place where it was
taken.&nbsp; But we believe that the former&rsquo;s right to it
was, in the end, established.&nbsp; There have been other
instances of whales being taken on this coast, though it happens
but rarely.</p>
<p>On December 2nd. 1763, a dreadful high wind and tide made
great ravages here: many ships were wrecked on the coast, and an
incredible number of cattle and sheep were drowned in Marshland,
&amp;c.&nbsp; Among other sufferers, a Mr. Barrell and a Mr.
Corfe, of Snettisham, lost 800 sheep each, as we find in the
<i>Norfolk Remembrancer</i>.&mdash;In the following year, during
the second mayoralty of Philip Case, the town, according to one
of our MS. narratives, was served a trick which <a
name="page945"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 945</span>could not
possibly redound to the credit of our rulers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Purfleet Fleet was then cleaned, from the bridge to the
clough adjoining to Kettle Mills river; and the filth and mud
carried away by boats into the haven, to the great annoyance of
the harbour and the forming of a bar there.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
certainly bad enough, but the worst is still behind.&nbsp; The
charge of scouring or cleaning the Fleets, it seems, belonged to
the corporation: but, in this instance, it was contrived to throw
it on the inhabitants, who were accordingly subjected to an
assessment, or tax, which amounted to a sum of no less than
2000<i>l.</i>&nbsp; This, to say the least of it, seems to have
been a very shabby affair; but some will think it much less so
than our famous <i>paving jobb</i>.</p>
<p>In the third mayoralty of John Cary senior, which commenced in
1765, a shocking murder was committed here by one John Rudderham,
(commonly and ironically called <i>honest John</i>) for which
bloody and horrid deed he was soon after tried, condemned, and
executed.&nbsp; Such, it has been said, was the deplorable
depravity and ignorance of this unhappy wretch, that he appeared
not to have any sense of moral evil, or any idea of the existence
of a Supreme Being, and of a future state.&nbsp; Though born and
brought up in a christian country, and even deemed a member of a
christian church, yet he was utterly ignorant of every thing
belonging to christianity, as appeared from the first
conversation he had with a person who attended him while under
sentence of death.&nbsp; Being asked by that person, if he had <a
name="page946"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 946</span><i>ever
heard of the Lord Jesus Christ</i>?&nbsp; He seriously answered
that he could not positively say whether he had or not:
&ldquo;and yet (said he) I do rather think that I have really
heard something of <i>such a gentleman</i>, though I cannot now
remember what it was.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is to be feared there were
a great many more here at the same time in a similar predicament,
or equally ignorant.&nbsp; Yet, if we are not misinformed, a
motion made, about that period, to establish here a school for
the instruction of poor children, was actually negatived, as a
needless and useless measure, and what might prove inimical to
social order, and destructive of all intellectual distinction
between rich and poor, gentlemen and plebeians.&nbsp; It is
pleasing to contemplate that our higher powers were actuated by
better and nobler ideas latterly, when the Lancasterian school
was proposed and established.&nbsp; May this prove the dawn of a
more liberal and brighter day.</p>
<p>In 1768, during the mayoralty of Charles Turner, which
commenced the preceding year, the town was much agitated by a
very violent contested election, chiefly between Sir John Turner
bart. and Crisp Molineaux Esq; for the honourable Thomas Walpole
Esq. the other candidate, was apparently pretty sure of gaining
his election.&nbsp; He was accordingly returned, and Sir John
along with him, owing, as one of our MS. narratives suggests, to
the bribing exertions of a certain eminent merchant, who expended
7000<i>l.</i> and upwards on the occasion.&nbsp; It was, however,
the last time Sir John was returned for this town: Molineaux was
returned along with Walpole at the next general election.&nbsp;
After <a name="page947"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
947</span>all, it seems to have been a very foolish business; for
this same candidate does not appear to have been a person of any
character, or who was endowed with such talents or qualifications
as could recommend him for a senator in preference to
Turner.&nbsp; Such has been, however, too often the case in our
contested elections.</p>
<p>This is supposed to have been the greatest of all our
Contested Elections, except that very memorable one in 1747,
which probably far exceeded every thing of the kind ever known
here.&nbsp; As the particulars of it were little known to the
present writer, till his observations on the preceding reign had
been printed off, he hopes the reader will excuse his giving some
account of it here, though somewhat out of place.&nbsp; The
opposition was chiefly aimed against Sir John Turner, the same,
seemingly, that was opposed in the last mentioned contest, and
father of the present Lady Folkes.&nbsp; His opponent was William
Folkes Esq. father of the present Sir Martin.&nbsp; He is said to
have been a very respectable man, though he was charged on this
occasion with breach of a promise made to Lord Orford, not to
stand candidate at that time for this town.&nbsp; What foundation
there was for such a charge, or how the case really stood, it may
be now difficult, or, perhaps, impossible to determine.</p>
<p>Though the prejudice against Turner was strong and extensive,
and the opposition fierce and violent, yet he gained his
election; but he was thought to owe it less to his own interest
and management than to the favour <a name="page948"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 948</span>and influence of the Walpoles, who
were supposed to have greatly befriended him in that
instance.&nbsp; At the close of the poll the numbers
were&mdash;for <i>Walpole</i> 199; for <i>Turner</i> 184; for
<i>Folkes</i> 131.&nbsp; The following Extract of a Letter
written at that very time by a person of much wit and shrewdness,
and who was an eye witness of the whole scene, will give the
reader a striking, and we presume a just idea of the state of
this town during that turbulent contest.&nbsp; Whether or not we
are still capable of the like excesses, or extravagances, is a
question that may not be unworthy of very serious
consideration.&nbsp; It is to be wished it might he answered in
the <i>negative</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Since you left us,&rdquo; (says the
Letter-writer alluded to,) &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve had a Contested
Election, and perhaps as violent an one as any in England where
the affair was not carried to bloodshed.&nbsp; I will be very
particular in my account of it because &rsquo;twill amuse
you.&mdash;The sudden bringing on the Elections all over England
was a wise thing.&nbsp; As soon as &rsquo;twas known here that
members were to be elected in about 3 weeks time, people of the
lower sort got together in the Evenings in clusters, talking, how
little good *** did to the town, &amp;c.&mdash;This set a spirit
agoing, and in 2 or 3 nights, they met about xxxv of &rsquo;em,
at an alehouse, with C&mdash; P&mdash;t drunk at the head of
them, whom they would fain have for a m&mdash;r of
p&mdash;t.&nbsp; C&mdash;s treated the company, and the next
morning gave them a whet, met &rsquo;em again in the evening, and
the next evening, and then had shewn spite enough to *** whom he
hates, to make it necessary for <a name="page949"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 949</span>them to look about &rsquo;em.&nbsp;
But where should they look?&nbsp; *** was in Gl&mdash;rshire with
his wife, who was every moment expecting to cry out, and had sent
a Letter, hoping to be chosen without coming at all.&nbsp;
L&mdash;d O. was at H&mdash;n and his cousin H&mdash;&rsquo;s son
being the person that was to stand with S&mdash;r J&mdash;, my
L&mdash;d was applied to, by our gentlemen, to let him know that
the people grew rude and clamorous, and that unless somebody
appeared, and care was taken of them, they feared Mr. F&mdash;s
might be induced to give &rsquo;em some trouble, by becoming a
candidate.&nbsp; My L&mdash;d told them there was no fear of
that, for he had a Letter from Mr. F&mdash;s the post before,
utterly disclaiming any design of that sort, which Letter he
shewed them.&nbsp; So they all came away satisfied.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding their satisfaction, and the good grounds any body
would have thought they had for it, within 4 days after this
F&mdash;s came down, and was introduced by A. T&mdash;, Dr.
B&mdash;, H. F&mdash;, J. F&mdash;, J&mdash;n M&mdash;r, and
several more, in coaches, chaises, &amp;c. several 100 horsemen,
Flags, Guns, Drums, and all the Racket that could possibly be
made.&nbsp; Neither T&mdash; nor W&mdash; were here, and all were
in distraction.&nbsp; Expresses were sent.&nbsp; L&mdash;d O. got
here that night.&nbsp; S&mdash; J&mdash; could not possibly get
here of two days and half.&nbsp; So on the Saturday night he
came, and the Election was to be on the Monday.&nbsp; From the
time of F&mdash;s setting out from London, the Public Houses were
opened, and continued so; so that here was nothing but men and
women and children drunk, old women especially, wallowing about
the streets, and half of &rsquo;em with their backsides exposed
to public view, and fellows a clapping of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page950"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 950</span>By
this time every one must clearly see what a Bedlam of a place
Lynn was, during this electioneering bustle.&nbsp; Our
Letter-writer, no doubt, gives a pretty faithful and correct
picture of what then occurred; on which account some of our
readers will be desirous of hearing him further: but as his
description now occasionally becomes somewhat coarse, if not
indelicate, we shall place the remainder of the extract below,
that those who wish to see more of it may have an opportunity to
gratify themselves. <a name="citation950"></a><a

history.</p>

our parliamentary representatives, in his contest with Molineaux,
and was sometime after chosen mayor of <a
name="page952"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 952</span>this town;
yet his influence here soon appeared to be fast declining.&nbsp;
His friends in the Hall resigned and withdrew, one after another,
till the interest of that family became at last quite
annihilated, after having been very great, and almost unrivalled,
for a whole century.&nbsp; But there is nothing strange or
wonderful in this.&nbsp; It is the usual course of things in this
world.&nbsp; Families, as well as nations and empires, have their
day, beyond which they cannot extend their power, or their
greatness.</p>
<p>About the year 1769 our corporation had a great lawsuit with a
Mr. Carr of Massingham, father of our late merchant of that
name.&nbsp; But they lost their cause; owing, as it has been
suggested, to the perjury <a name="page953"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 953</span>of one of Carr&rsquo;s principal
witnesses.&nbsp; The suit is said to have been brought on to
oblige the corporation to open and scour the Fleet from
Salter&rsquo;s Sluice to Littleport-bridge, which was necessary
for the accommodation of the plaintiff, who had granaries
contiguous to that fleet.&nbsp; The corporation, on their part,
pleaded that the flood-door of the bridge had been put down a
hundred years before, and therefore that the requisition could
not be binding upon them.&nbsp; But the said witness, who was
only 56 years old, swore that he had in his youth, for the sake
of robbing an orchard, swam over, near Salter&rsquo;s clough,
when the water there was ten feet deep.&nbsp; This satisfied the
jury, and determined them to give their verdict against the
corporation.&nbsp; They were consequently obliged to clear and
open the said fleet; and it has been kept so ever since; which
seems very proper and necessary.&nbsp; But supposing it really
true, that the work had been neglected, and the fleet suffered to
silt and fill up for a whole century; still, even that very
neglect must have been the fault of the corporation, who are
bound to keep the fleets open; so that they could not be
justified in resisting Mr. Carr&rsquo;s requisition.&nbsp; To
have removed the nuisance, at once, instead of going to law, had
been far more creditable.</p>
<p>About the year 1770, a very unusual and marvellous phenomenon
appeared here; which was no other than a violent patriotic
spirit, or what in more recent times, or modern cant, would have
been denominated <i>Jacobinism</i>.&nbsp; Our Gentlemen seemed
then, all of a sudden, <a name="page954"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 954</span>to have become mighty admirers of
liberty, and of <i>John Wilkes</i>.&nbsp; That redoubted champion
of freedom was soon invited to this town, and actually honoured
it with his patriotic presence in February 1771, to the no small
joy of our body corporate, who received him with open arms,
entertained him most sumptuously, and conferred upon him the
freedom of this ancient borough.&nbsp; All this was very
well.&nbsp; We do not mean to blame them for it.&nbsp; But it was
very different from the treatment, or reception, which another
patriot, of no less virtue and respectability, met with here at a
subsequent period.&nbsp; We mean <i>Thelwall</i>, who visited us
some years ago, for the purpose of promulgating the principles of
political liberty and genuine patriotism.&nbsp; But those
principles, by that time, were become so very unfashionable and
disreputable here, that the patriotic lecturer could get no
hearing; and he was glad to escape with a whole skin and unbroken
bones.&nbsp; The politicks of <i>William Pitt</i> had now
completely superseded those of <i>John Wilkes</i>.&nbsp; So the
world goes: what is sound doctrine, at one time, is heresy and
sedition, and even blasphemy and treason, at another.</p>
<p>At the time of which we have been last speaking, our dispute
with the American patriots had made considerable progress: and it
might be supposed that as this town appeared so decidedly and
warmly in favour of Wilkes, it would have appeared no less so in
favour of the Americans.&nbsp; But it happened far
otherwise.&nbsp; We eagerly caressed Wilkes, and openly espoused
his cause, but towards the oppressed and much injured Americans
<a name="page955"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 955</span>we
appeared very differently affected.&nbsp; During that long and
unhappy dispute, and the unjust and bloody war that ensued, no
measure was here adopted expressive of abhorrence, or even of
disapprobation of the course taken by our government; or yet of
concern and commiseration for the unmerited sufferings of our
transatlantic brethren.&nbsp; How much more honourable and
dignified had it been to have acted differently, and boldly borne
our testimony against the injustice and folly of our own
government, and in behalf of the reasonable and well-founded
claims of the colonists?&nbsp; How respectable, in that case,
would Lynn have now appeared among its sister boroughs, when the
whole reasonable and enlightened world, with one voice, is
reprobating that dispute, and that war, as the undoubted
offspring of the most tyrannic disposition, or the most perfect
insanity? <a name="citation955"></a><a href="#footnote955"
class="citation">[955]</a>&nbsp; Nor is it at all improbable that
impartial posterity will consider our subsequent wars, and not a
few of our public transactions, as having actually sprung from
the same parentage.</p>
<p>Soon after the commencement of the American War the great
maritime powers discovered a strong disposition to favour the
resistance of the colonists, which gave us no small offence; so
that by degrees things came to an open rupture between this
country and those powers.&nbsp; France, Spain, and Holland,
accordingly, became <a name="page956"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 956</span>parties in the contest; and the
northern armed neutrality, with the general aspect of all other
nations, pretty plainly shewed that there was scarcely a single
state throughout Christendom, but what decidedly and heartily
reprobated the part we were acting.&nbsp; It was therefore no
wonder that the American war did prove unsuccessful, and
eventually terminate in the discomfiture and disgrace of this
country; and even stamp upon our counsels indelible and eternal
infamy.</p>
<p>The effect of the war with America, and with the European
powers before mentioned, was severely felt at Lynn.&nbsp; Our
trade was much cramped, many of our ships were captured, our
sailors were reduced mostly to old men and lads, by those
guardians of the constitution, and demonstrators of the
unalienableness of our rights, and reality of our freedom, the
<i>press gangs</i>.&nbsp; These myrmidons, when any of our young
and best sailors fell in their way, if they did not tamely submit
to be taken, would pursue them like wild beasts, and, when they
came up with them, would knock them on the head, like dogs, with
their bludgeons, and then drag them with the utmost indignity to
the house of rendezvous, or on board the tender.&nbsp; There the
poor fellows were left to cool, and compose themselves: and the
very next day, perhaps, would be heard singing, in the house of
their captivity, &ldquo;Rule Britannia;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Britons
never will be slaves.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be well for the nation,
or, at least, for its rulers, that the ideas of our sea-faring
people, respecting liberty and thraldom, are considerably
different from those of some other <a name="page957"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 957</span>people.&mdash;Being now come to the
end of the first twenty years of this reign, we shall here close
the present section.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> IX.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Lynn armed Association&mdash;termination of
the American War&mdash;independence of the United States
acknowledged and confirmed&mdash;peace restored and established
among all the belligerent powers&mdash;King&rsquo;s illness and
recovery</i>&mdash;<i>View of the state of this town from that
period to the present time</i>.</p>
<p>The situation of this country, engaged in a foolish,
fruitless, ruinous, and infamous war with its own colonies, at
the distance of more than a thousand leagues, and involved
afterwards in a desperate struggle with its great maritime
neighbours, became very critical, and excited considerable alarm
throughout the kingdom.&nbsp; Great fears were entertained of an
invasion, and means of defence against such an attempt were
resorted to.&nbsp; The Irish, deprived of the military force that
used to be stationed in their country, armed themselves for their
own protection, at their own expense.&nbsp; The like was done in
many parts of England; and Lynn adopted the same measure.&nbsp;
The Lynn Volunteers, or armed association, amounted to about 120,
<a name="citation957"></a><a href="#footnote957"
class="citation">[957]</a> and were commanded <a
name="page958"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 958</span>in chief by
<i>Captain Thomas Day</i>, whose name we have had occasion to
mention more than once in some of the preceding pages.</p>
<p>This gentleman&rsquo;s military knowledge and talents were
generally allowed to be superior to those of any other of our
townsmen, and his unassuming demeanor, and conciliating manners
eminently fitted him for the chief command of this corps.&nbsp;
The officers and men, accordingly, became greatly attached to
him, and the utmost harmony subsisted among them, to the very
last.&nbsp; During the whole time they were imbodied, the
behaviour of the men, in the town, was very proper and
commendable, and quite to the satisfaction of the inhabitants;
which redounded much to the credit of the officers, and
particularly the commandant, whose orders and example would not
fail to contribute largely to the regularity or correctness of
their deportment.&nbsp; This respectable and memorable little
band was formed and organized in 1779, and continued till
sometime after the expiration of the war; for it was not
disbanded till 1785, when its constituents, relinquishing the
military character, mixed once more with the great mass of
unarmed citizens; conscious, it may be presumed, of having so
acquitted themselves as to merit the approbation and applause of
their contemporaries, and of posterity.&mdash;Of these
patriot-soldiers some further notice may be taken when we shall
have to notice our more recent and more numerous volunteer
armaments.</p>
<p><a name="page959"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 959</span>Peace
was restored among all the belligerent powers in 1783, when the
independence of the resisting colonies, now called the <i>United
States</i> of America, was acknowledged and confirmed.&nbsp; The
American war ended, as all such unjust wars ought to end, in the
disappointment and discomfiture of the aggressors.&nbsp; But had
our government, and our nation possessed a proper degree of
virtue, or conscience, they would certainly have expressed both
shame and remorse, after the contest was over, and when they had
time calmly to reflect upon the part they had acted in that most
unjustifiable and detestable business.&nbsp; Nothing however of
that kind did appear.&nbsp; On the contrary we sat down very
demurely and composedly, without the least apparent feeling of
contrition, sorrow, or self-reproach; like <i>Solomon&rsquo;s
adulterous woman</i>, who eat, and wiped her mouth, and said,
&ldquo;I have done no wickedness.&rdquo; <a
name="citation959"></a><a href="#footnote959"
class="citation">[959]</a></p>
<p>The impenitent spirit which our government and nation
manifested at the close of the American war, could furnish no
reason to hope that it was the last scene of folly and iniquity
in which our rulers would engage: and if any did actually cherish
such a hope, they must long ago have been convinced that it was
altogether vain and groundless.&nbsp; All our subsequent wars,
state policy, and maxims of government have but too plainly
indicated that we have acted ever since, almost invariably, under
the guidance of that same Evil Genius that so eggregiously
misled, befooled, and governed us, during the whole American
dispute and war, and which <a name="page960"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 960</span>had before involved us in the guilt
of exterminating the poor hapless Caribbs, as well as in that of
other unjustifiable and criminal deeds previously to those
events.</p>
<p>Some of our pretended longsighted, as well as long-headed
politicians affected to foresee and foretell a very long season
of uninterrupted tranquillity succeeding the peace of 1783.&nbsp;
But it proved all a dream: for we have been most of the time
since at war; and such a war too as we never experienced
before.&nbsp; It has proved most miserably unsuccessful and
disastrous; and is now in a fair way of saddling upon us at last
an unexampled debt of <i>a thousand millions</i>! <a
name="citation960a"></a><a href="#footnote960a"
class="citation">[960a]</a>&mdash;Such an enormous sum as the
whole coinage of the universe could not discharge.&mdash;This is
a frightful prospect; but we will now turn to other
objects.&mdash;But before we quit the year 1783 we may just
observe that a most atrocious robbery was then committed on a Jew
lad, about 16 years old, of the name of <i>Isaac Levi</i>, on the
road between Lynn and Westwinch, by one <i>Robert Fox</i>, whoso
ill treated the poor Jew as to leave him apparently dead; for
which the robber was sometime after, (September 7th.) hanged on
Hardwick common, near the place where the villanous and shocking
deed had been perpetrated. <a name="citation960b"></a><a
href="#footnote960b" class="citation">[960b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page961"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 961</span>In
1784 we had here another contested Election, which, however, in
point of violence was much inferior to those of 1768 and
1747.&nbsp; Mr. Fountaine of Narford was now the new candidate,
whose character, certainly, was no way inferior to that of either
of his opponents.&nbsp; But he lost his election, though he had a
respectable number of voters, and the old members, Walpole and
Molineux were again returned, than whom no two men had perhaps
less distinguished themselves in the preceding parliament, or
appeared less worthy to be re-elected.&nbsp; But they suited the
taste and humour of the majority of their constituents, and
especially of some two or three or few men who had the chief
share or influence in their appointment.&nbsp; Our parliamentary
representation is a very fine thing in theory, but in practice it
is often found far otherwise.</p>
<p>But though this Election was conducted with decency and
moderation, in comparison with those of 1768 and 47, yet it was
attended with circumstances not a little disgraceful to the
dispositions and characters of some of the leading actors,
particularly on the victorious side.&nbsp; The aristocratic
spirit and malignant passions were but too apparent; and not a
few of the minor or unsuccessful party were made long to feel the
resentment and vindictiveness of their powerful opponents, who
were not much disposed to suffer the infallibility of their
judgment to be questioned, or allow any with impunity to
disapprove the objects of their choice or nomination.&nbsp; But
this intolerance, and especially resentment and <a
name="page962"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
962</span>vindictiveness, must, most assuredly, be highly
criminal and iniquitous on such occasions, since every voter,
even the very poorest, has an undoubted right to give his voice
freely for the candidate or candidates whom he deems most worthy
of his suffrage.&nbsp; Whoever deprives a freeman of this
privilege uses him worse than a highwayman.</p>
<p>Not only the electors of the poorer sort, who had voted for
Mr. Fountaine, and lived in the town, suffered in consequence of
having exercised their just rights on that occasion, but even the
richer ones did not entirely escape: for those of them who held
lands of the corporation were now deprived of the same, as well
as of every other privilege which lay in the power of their
revengeful opponents.&nbsp; This was carrying things with a high
hand.&nbsp; After all, it may be no great wonder that our
corporation should be still tenacious of having the
representatives of their town to be men of their own nomination
and choosing, considering that no one formerly, or till within
these 170 years, <i>except those of the Hall</i>, appear to have
had any share or concern in the appointment or election of those
who represented this borough in parliament. <a
name="citation962"></a><a href="#footnote962"
class="citation">[962]</a></p>
<p><a name="page963"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 963</span>It
is, indeed generally supposed that matters are now here on a much
fairer and more rational footing; but that, perhaps, will not
appear very clearly when we advert to the well known truth and
fact, that out modern members for the most part, owe their
senatorial honour and elevation solely to the will and pleasure,
or power and influence of some two or three families or
individuals.&nbsp; Such, however, is but two often the practical
character of our boasted system of parliamentary
representation.</p>
<p>That of 1784 was the last contested election that has taken
place here; though some faint attempt is said to have been made
for something of this kind a few years ago, in favour of one of
our military aldermen, who was supposed not to have been very
much taken with the compliment, or, at least, did not choose to
be very active in promoting his own election; not, however, that
he was at all incapable of great, and even extraordinary <a
name="page964"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
964</span>electioneering feats in behalf of his friends, of which
he is understood to have given, before now, unequivocal and
convincing proof.&nbsp; In short, it would seem as if he were,
(in cases of that kind especially,) more ready to serve other
people than himself; which, to say the least of it, is a conduct
not a little unusual in this degenerate and selfish age: and it
may serve as a proof that generosity and disinterestedness are
not yet become totally extinct among us.</p>
<p>From the year 1785, when our volunteers were disbanded, till
1788, we recollect no very remarkable event that related to this
town. <a name="citation964"></a><a href="#footnote964"
class="citation">[964]</a>&nbsp; In the last mentioned year, one
of the Annual Registers of that period relates a most singular
accident which then befel a captain <i>Cook</i>, master of one of
our greenland-ships.&nbsp; The account is as
follows&mdash;&ldquo;August 1788: Friday last arrived at Lynn in
Norfolk, the Archangel, from Greenland, captain Cook, with two
fish.&nbsp; It was with much difficulty she got safe there,
having received a deal of damage in a gale of wind, which drove
her against a field of ice.&nbsp; When this ship was in
Greenland, captain Cook, the surgeon, and mate, went on shore,
when the captain was seized by a monstrous bear, which
immediately hugged him with his paws.&nbsp; The captain called to
the surgeon to fire at the creature, though at fifty yards
distance, which he did, and fortunately shot the <a
name="page965"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 965</span>bear
through the head, which instantly killed it, and captain Cook was
by this means saved from being torn in pieces.&rdquo; <a
name="citation965"></a><a href="#footnote965"
class="citation">[965]</a>&nbsp; We cannot vouch for the absolute
correctness or authenticity of this anecdote, which certainly
savours somewhat of the marvellous.&nbsp; It is inserted here
entirely on the authority of the periodical work alluded
to.&nbsp; But it is certain that there was here a greenland
captain of the name of <i>Cook</i>, about that period.</p>
<p>The 5th. of November 1788 was observed at Lynn, in
commemoration of the landing of king William, and of the glorious
revolution that ensued, by a party of the friends of civil and
religious liberty, among whom were the late reverend and worthy
<i>William Warner</i>, and the writer of the present work.&nbsp;
The party spent the evening at one of the Inns, where they supped
together, and passed the time in the most perfect harmony and
conviviality, and no way unworthy of the occasion, or of the
great, glorious, and interesting event which they were then
commemorating.&nbsp; <i>Holkham</i>, the princely mansion of Mr.
Coke, was the only other place in West Norfolk, as far as the
present writer has ever understood, where the centenary of the
revolution was thought worth celebrating.&nbsp; That great event
was there celebrated by a grand f&ecirc;te, ball and supper,
display of fireworks, &amp;c.&nbsp; All in a manner worthy of the
patriotic character, revolution principles, and noble munificence
of the renowned master of the mansion.</p>
<p>In the latter part of the autumn and the winter of 1788, the
good people of Lynn shared with the rest of their fellow <a
name="page966"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 966</span>subjects in
the general solicitude, perplexity, and dismay occasioned by the
sovereign&rsquo;s alarming illness.&nbsp; His majesty&rsquo;s
health had been for sometime gradually declining; which was then
ascribed to overmuch exercise, too severe a regimen, too rigid
abstemiousness, and too short intervals of rest, rather than to
the freedom of indulgence and the softness of luxury.&nbsp; As a
remedy for the symptoms that discovered themselves, the king
determined to visit the medical waters of Cheltenham, and
accordingly set out for that place immediately after the
prorogation of parliament, where he arrived in the afternoon of
the 13th. of July, being the next day after he had left
Windsor.&nbsp; He was accompanied by the queen, the princess
royal, princess Augusta, and princess Elizabeth: and in every
town through which he passed, he was received by vast crowds of
people, with every demonstration of affection and loyalty.&nbsp;
While at Cheltenham, he resided at lord Fauconberg&rsquo;s lodge,
on an eminence, a quarter of a mile from the town, and about 300
yards from the Spa. <a name="citation966"></a><a
href="#footnote966" class="citation">[966]</a></p>
<p><a name="page967"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 967</span>His
majesty&rsquo;s stay at Cheltenham was about five weeks.&nbsp; He
returned to the metropolis on the 18th of August.&nbsp; But no
benefit answerable to the expectations that had been formed,
resulted from this excursion.&nbsp; His health was still in a
precarious state, and on the 22nd of October, symptoms <a
name="citation967"></a><a href="#footnote967"
class="citation">[967]</a> were observed by one of the royal
physicians, of that alienation of mind which was afterwards the
occasion of so many important and interesting transactions.&nbsp;
For some time it was thought proper to observe as much secrecy as
possible respecting the nature of the king&rsquo;s
indisposition.&nbsp; His retreat at Windsor was favourable to
this purpose; and for several days an opinion was entertained by
the people in general, that his indisposition was a fever, and
that it had risen to so alarming a height as to threaten a speedy
dissolution.&nbsp; The real nature of the case however could not
long be suppressed.&nbsp; By the structure and practice of the
English constitution, almost every species of public business is
in some manner implicated with the royal prerogatives.&nbsp; The
administration of political government was by the present event
virtually suspended from its functions; and, notwithstanding the
critical situation of Europe, and the very active share we had
lately taken in its concerns, it was now deemed impracticable to
return any sort of answer to the dispatches of foreign courts, or
of our own ambassadors.&nbsp; In this situation the most <a
name="page968"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 968</span>natural
expedient was to suffer the two houses of parliament, which stood
prorogued to the 20th of November, to meet at that time, and
either adjourn for a short interval, or immediately proceed to
discuss the measures it would be proper to adopt at the present
crisis.&nbsp; Circular letters were accordingly addressed to the
members of the legislature on the 14th, signifying to them, that
the indisposition of the sovereign rendered it doubtful whether
there would be a possibility of receiving his commands for the
further prorogation of parliament.&nbsp; In that case the two
houses must of necessity assemble, and the attendance of the
different members was earnestly requested. <a
name="citation968a"></a><a href="#footnote968a"
class="citation">[968a]</a></p>
<p>Such was the outset of that memorable affair, which caused so
much anxiety and agitation, at that time, in this town and
throughout the kingdom.&nbsp; The right of the heir apparent to
assume the executive power, during the incapacity of the
sovereign, was denied by the minister, <a
name="citation968b"></a><a href="#footnote968b"
class="citation">[968b]</a> and by a large majority of both
houses of the English parliament.&nbsp; Nevertheless they
appointed him to exercise that power, under such restrictions as
would secure to the ministers the possession of their
places.&nbsp; The prince reluctantly acceded to the appointment,
and consented to act under those restrictions.&nbsp;
<i>Ireland</i> being then a separate kingdom, its parliament took
a very different course, admitting the prince&rsquo;s right, <a
name="page969"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 969</span>and
resolving to offer him the regency without restrictions.&nbsp;
Having so done, a deputation was appointed to wait on the prince,
and give their resolutions their full effect.&nbsp; This
deputation actually arrived in London; but before they had
accomplished the end of their mission, symptoms began to appear
indicative of the sovereign&rsquo;s speedy recovery; and on the
12th of February 1789 he was declared by his physicians to be in
a state of progressive amendment.</p>
<p>This put an end, of course, to all further proceeding in the
regency business, on the part of either the English or Irish
parliament, and filled all ranks of people with the utmost joy
and exultation.&nbsp; Nothing could exceed the gladness which was
then every where expressed; and Norfolk came not a whit behind
its most distinguished sister counties in the demonstration of
its joy, and display of its loyalty.&nbsp; Nor was there any
place in the county where this was more manifest than at
Lynn.&nbsp; The 18th of March, if we are not mistaken, was the
time when this was most strikingly and splendidly
demonstrated.&nbsp; We had then here a general illumination, and
other public rejoicings, with such other corresponding
exhibitions and grand doings as exceeded every thing that had
been known among us within the memory of the oldest
inhabitant.&nbsp; In short we had, in miniature at least,
something of almost every thing that the greatest cities, or even
the metropolis itself could then boast of.</p>
<p><a name="page970"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 970</span>Had
the regency then taken place it is impossible to ascertain
whether it would have proved a blessing to the nation, or
otherwise.&nbsp; The people seemed much in fear of the intended
regent, on the score of expensiveness and running in debt; but
there is no reason to suppose that his government would have been
more expensive, or more productive of additional taxes than that
which has existed in this country ever since.&nbsp; On the
contrary it is highly probable that it would have been much less
so, as it may be presumed that the prince would not have been
quite so fond of war as the ministers and party that have been
predominant for the last twenty years.&nbsp; As the 18th of March
was observed here as a day of <i>rejoicing</i> for the
king&rsquo;s recovery, so was the 23rd. of April observed as a
day of <i>thanksgiving</i> on the same occasion, both here and
throughout the kingdom.&nbsp; Many years have been since added to
the sovereign&rsquo;s life, and his reign has proved far longer
than that of any one of his predecessors, who was not an infant
or minor at the time of his accession.&nbsp; He has also lived to
witness greater changes in the state of Europe than had taken
place within the last thousand years:&mdash;and changes too which
the measures of the British cabinet had a principal share in
producing.&nbsp; But we will now dismiss these subjects.</p>
<p>From the time of the king&rsquo;s recovery to the commencement
of the memorable coalition and grand crusade against
revolutionary France, nothing very remarkable occurred here,
except the dispute between this corporation and that of London,
about the right of <a name="page971"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
971</span>those who are free of the latter to an exemption from
the payment of tolls in this port; which terminated in the full
establishment of that right, and the disannulment of the
objections which this corporation had set up against it.&nbsp;
The persons on whose account this dispute originated, were the
<i>Dentons</i>, two of our merchants of that period, who obtained
the freedom of London, after having long solicited that of Lynn
in vain, and offered any sum for it which our gentlemen would
choose to demand.&nbsp; Being still required to pay toll, as
before, they made their complaint to the corporation of London,
which brought on a lawsuit between the two corporations.&nbsp;
The cause was first tried in the court of common pleas, where it
was given against Lynn, and if we mistake not, with considerable
damages; to escape which it was afterwards removed by writ of
error to the court of king&rsquo;s bench: of the result the
following account is given in one of the periodical publications
of that time.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jan. 28. 1791, The case of the city of
London against the corporation of Lynn, came on to be argued in
the court of king&rsquo;s bench.&nbsp; It was a writ of error
from the court of common pleas where a trial at bar was had on a
<i>de essendo quietum de theolonio</i> (of being quit of toll)
brought by the city of London, to assert the right of their
citizens being exempted from a toll on corn, demanded by the
corporation of Lynn.&nbsp; A verdict had been given for the city,
and the errors were assigned on the informality of the
declaration.&nbsp; After much argument by serjeant Le Blanc, for
Lynn, and sergeant Adair, for London, the court reversed the
judgment, on the ground that the declaration <a
name="page972"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 972</span>did not
state that the city of London had received such an injury on
which an action could be maintained, the corporation of Lynn
having demanded, but not having received, or distrained for the
tolls in question.&rdquo; <a name="citation972"></a><a
href="#footnote972" class="citation">[972]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though our corporation, by this last decision, seem to have
been relieved from the payment of the heavy damages that would
have resulted from the first verdict, yet the whole affair must
have been attended with no light expence, which certain plans of
economy subsequently adopted, and other attendant appearances
pretty clearly evinced.&nbsp; How much wiser had it been to grant
those two gentlemen their freedom at once, to which they were so
clearly entitled by the great benefit which the town derived from
their extensive mercantile exertions.&nbsp; Indeed the refusal of
it was a piece of flagrant injustice, as persons who contributed
so much as they did to the increase of our trade ought to have
received in the town every possible encouragement.&nbsp; The
treatment they met with here, proves the defectiveness of our
corporation laws and borough charters, and how ill adapted they
are to the present state of society in this country.&nbsp;
Sheffield, Manchester, and Birmingham, where things are on a
different footing, sufficiently evince the inutility and folly of
our borough laws and establishments, and that they are, in fact,
grievances and nuisances rather than national benefits.&nbsp;
Their abolition seems therefore an object or event to be wished
rather than deprecated.</p>
<p><a name="page973"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 973</span>The
year 1792 has been rendered memorable by the <i>royal
proclamation</i>, issued on the 21st. of May, &ldquo;for
preventing of tumultuous meetings and seditious writings;&rdquo;
and by the formation of <i>Reeve&rsquo;s Association</i>, on the
20th. of November, at the Crown and Anchor, &ldquo;for preserving
Liberty and Property, against Republicans and
Levellers.&rdquo;&nbsp; These sapient measures had the desired
effect, and operated mightily every where, as well as in this
town.&nbsp; Treasury or ministerial agents were appointed in
every town and district, and Lynn was not forgotten.&nbsp; Those
agents were to observe what publications were in circulation, and
to apprize the Treasury board of such as they were pleased to
deem of dangerous tendency.&nbsp; Not only the drift or scope of
political publications were objects of their observation and
watchfulness, but also the carriage, or conduct and conversation,
and even the social and convivial intercourse of all such
individuals as happened to disapprove of the politics of the
court, or of the accession of this country to the grand
confederacy and crusade against France.</p>
<p>A system of espionage was artfully formed and established, and
the whole country being filled with spies and informers,
exhibited a miserable scene of hypocrisy and dissimulation,
instead of the blunt sincerity, and the boasted uprightness and
downrightness of other and better times.&nbsp; This new order of
things was admirably calculated to bear down and overwhelm the
minister&rsquo;s opponents.&nbsp; Some of the most eminent and
respectable men in the nation were accordingly marked out as
disaffected or suspicious characters, merely because they <a
name="page974"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 974</span>entertained
different views from the minister and his associates, and
endeavoured to prevent this country from joining the continental
crusade, and even wished to see the blessings of liberty extend
all over the world.</p>
<p>Most of the mobility as well as the nobility of the realm, and
a large majority of both houses of parliament, being decidedly in
favour of the minister, he carried every thing before him with a
high hand, ruled for years with a rod of iron, and his little
finger became heavier than the loins of any of his predecessors
since the revolution.&nbsp; A spirit was then by him awakened and
set to work, which had lain fast asleep ever since the days of
the Stuarts, and Lynn partook of it in no small measure.&nbsp;
The friends of peace and constitutional freedom, were here looked
upon and treated as ill-disposed persons, and unworthy
characters, scarcely entitled to the common rights of citizens,
or the lowest offices of humanity.&nbsp; Such were some of the
rare blessings we derived from the administration of the last
Pitt, who was at the same time hailed by multitudes as a heaven
born minister, the saviour of his country, and the wisest and
greatest of statesmen.&nbsp; Nothing more clearly evinces the
utter dissimilarity between his character and that of his
renowned father, than the insatiate vindictiveness of his
disposition towards those who opposed his measures; <a
name="citation974"></a><a href="#footnote974"
class="citation">[974]</a> of which there have been many very
glaring, and numerous instances.</p>
<p><a name="page975"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 975</span>His
reign terror was long and grievous.&nbsp; It lasted during nearly
the whole length of the late war.&nbsp; His successor, Addington
held the reins with a gentler hand, whatever may be said of his
ministerial talents or capacity.&nbsp; He also restored to us the
inestimable blessing of peace, which Pitt seemed incapable of
effecting.&nbsp; That peace however, proved of but short
duration, which yet might not be the fault of the minister.&nbsp;
We were not, it seems, sufficiently humbled, or really tired of
the horrid game of war, bloodshed and devastation: and so,
without taking time to breathe, we rushed headlong into a new
war, which has already lasted eight or nine years, and is likely
to prove the longest and most disastrous of any we have been
engaged in for many ages.&nbsp; God only knows when or how it
will terminate.</p>
<p>Great complaints having for sometime been made of the sad
state of fen-drainage in the parts above Lynn, much stir was made
on that account about the year 1794, and a Cut from Eaubrink to
Lynn-harbour was then proposed as a remedy for that growing
evil.&nbsp; The expediency of the measure being agreed upon, an
act of parliament was obtained in 1795 for its
accomplishment.&nbsp; <a name="page976"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 976</span>And though above fifteen years have
since elapsed, during most of which time a heavy tax has been
levied on the lands there, yet the projected cut, that was to
produce such vast benefits, is not yet begun: nor is it at all
certain, or even very probable at present, that it ever will,
notwithstanding the vast sums that have been collected, and are
still collecting for that purpose, from the respective
land-owners. <a name="citation976"></a><a href="#footnote976"
class="citation">[976]</a>&nbsp; The act of parliament that was
obtained, if not already renewed, must, it seems, be so soon,
because of this excessive procrastination.&nbsp; How many such
renewals must hereafter be resorted to before the work will
commence, it is impossible to say.&nbsp; The promoters of this
measure appear to have engaged in it before they were
sufficiently aware of the magnitude and arduousness of the
undertaking.&nbsp; <a name="page977"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
977</span>Their giving it up at last would therefore be no great
wonder.</p>
<p>In 1794 serious apprehensions of a French invasion began to be
pretty generally entertained in this kingdom; and in the summer
of that year a new body of volunteers was formed at Lynn, under
the command of alderman Edward Everard, junior.&nbsp; This was
more numerous than that which was formed here some years before,
and it continued embodied till the summer of 1802.&nbsp; The
present writer being most of that time out of town, cannot say
much from his own knowledge of the character of this corps, but
he believes it was very fair, and no way discommendable, or
discreditable to its worthy commandant: and this seems strongly
corroborated by a paragraph which appeared in the <i>Lynn
Packet</i> at the time when the corps was disbanded; <a
name="citation977"></a><a href="#footnote977"
class="citation">[977]</a> <a name="page978"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 978</span>which also records the very day when
that event took place.&mdash;Before we dismiss 1794, we may just
hint that we had here then a violent thunderstorm, when a young
girl was killed by the lightening.&nbsp; (See Norfolk
Remembrancer, p. 29.)</p>
<p>The year 1796 is rendered very memorable here by the fatal
disaster which happened then at the ferry in the mart time.&nbsp;
On the 23rd of February, about 6 o&rsquo;clock in the evening,
many people, to the number of forty or more, got into the
ferry-boat; and though the boat-men remonstrated with them, as
being too many to be taken over at once, yet so anxious were they
to get over without further delay that none of them could be
persuaded to get out and wait for the return of the boat, it was
a calm evening, but the tide was coming in very strong.&nbsp; The
boat however proceeded safely till it had almost reached the
opposite shore, when passing across some ropes belonging to a
vessel lying there, it received a violent concussion which laid
it pretty much on one side: at that moment the passengers,
instead of keeping their places, rushed headlong to the lower
side, and thereby overset the boat in an instant.&nbsp; Eleven of
them lost their lives; among whom was a man and his wife and
daughter; also two young persons on the point of marriage, who
were afterwards found clasped in each others arms.&nbsp; It is
rather wonderful that so many of them were saved; but it was said
<a name="page979"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 979</span>to be
owing to several boats being then very near the spot, which came
almost instantly to their assistance, and succeeded in picking up
and saving most of them.&nbsp; Although the Lynn ferry be but an
awkward kind of passage, yet this seems to have been the only
very serious accident that has occurred there for a very great
length of time.&nbsp; Our ferry-men in general are somewhat more
civil and decent than their brethren in other parts, who have
often been classed among the most rude and brutish of all our
countrymen.</p>
<p>In 1797 a whale measuring 44 feet, (according to the Norfolk
Remembrancer,) was caught in Lynn channel.&nbsp; In the course of
the same year our farmers are said to have discovered cleansing
seed-wheat <i>by water only</i>, (fresh water we suppose,) to be
the best and most certain preservative against the smut or
brand.&nbsp; If it be really so, many have been at a great deal
of needless trouble and expense in preparing their
seed-wheat.&nbsp; But such an imputation is by no means peculiar
to our wheat growers.&nbsp; It is commonly the case in a progress
of investigation and experiment.&nbsp; Many a highly and
generally esteemed practice or usage, beside those that have
obtained in the preparation of seed-corn, have been afterwards
found far from deserving the high estimation they had acquired,
and in which they had been long held. <a
name="citation979"></a><a href="#footnote979"
class="citation">[979]</a></p>
<p><a name="page980"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 980</span>In
the course of the year 1798, the fear of an invasion from France
became very strong and general in this part of the kingdom; which
occasioned our armed associations to be considerably
multiplied.&nbsp; Among the new armed companies which sprung up,
or were formed that year in this country, we read of the Holkham
Yeomanry Cavalry, commanded by T. W. Coke Esq. and E. Rolfe
Esq.&nbsp; The Freebridge Smithdon Yeomanry Cavalry, commanded by
H. Styleman Esq.&nbsp; The Freebridge Lynn Yeomanry Cavalry,
commanded by Joseph Taylor Esq. and the Swaffham ditto, commanded
by J. Micklethwaite Esq. &amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp; The very
<i>clergy</i> discovered a readiness and strong desire to learn
the use of arms, and one of them appears actually to have become
commandant of one of these new raised corps; for among the
military officers then enumerated <a name="page981"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 981</span>the name of the <i>revd. T.
Lloyd</i> appeared as captain of the <i>North Walsham Volunteer
company</i>.&nbsp; This clerical ardour for taking up arms was
said to be sometime after checked by episcopal authority,
otherwise we might have had before now a very great number of
<i>reverend</i> captains, and majors, and colonels.&nbsp; The
Freebridge Lynn Yeomanry Cavalry remain still undisbanded under
the orders of their original leader.&mdash;An Act passed this
year for draining &amp;c. the lands and fen grounds in Outwell,
Stow Bardolph, Wimbotsham, and Downham; which it is to be hoped
has answered much better than the <i>Feltwell</i> new drainage
act, which we have already noticed.&mdash;On the 29th. of
December this same year, at 11 <span class="GutSmall">P.M.</span>
the thermometer was said to be at 3 below 0: a degree of cold
never before noticed in this island&mdash;if we may rely on the
authority of the <i>Norfolk Remembrancer</i>.</p>
<p>The year 1799 was rendered somewhat remarkable here by an
attempt to establish a Newspaper, under the name of the <i>Lynn
and Wisbech Packet</i>; but it did not finally succeed, though
persevered in for several years.&nbsp; Lynn seems not favourably
situated for the success of such an undertaking, placed as it is
in a corner of the country, and the adjacent parts well supplied
with provincial papers of established repute and extensive
circulation.&nbsp; It was therefore, perhaps, a rash and hopeless
attempt, so that its relinquishment at last need not to excite
any great surprise.&nbsp; The projector hoped, when he resolved
to try this experiment, that it would prove a source of much
gain, but he found in the end <a name="page982"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 982</span>that what he gained by it was only a
pretty heavy loss, which placed him in the list of unfortunate
adventurers. <a name="citation982"></a><a href="#footnote982"
class="citation">[982]</a></p>
<p>But what rendered this year still more remarkable and
memorable, both here and throughout the kingdom, was the
origination, introduction, and operation of the <i>income
tax</i>, which now took place and will not be soon
forgotten.&nbsp; In former times this odious tax would have been
very unwelcome in this country, and probably deemed intolerable
by the whole nation.&nbsp; The people would have thought
themselves degraded to the lowest degree, in being obliged to
appear before certain of their own neighbours, in the character
of commissioners, and there disclose upon oath the amount of
their property and means of subsistence, in order to empower the
tax-gatherers to take from them a tenth part of their yearly
income, for the purpose of supporting and pursuing measures which
many of them utterly disapproved.&nbsp; This vile impost was
indeed doubly detestable, as it not only sunk the subjects below
the rank of freemen, but also laid before them a strong
incitement to falshood and perjury, and was, in all probability,
the means of greatly increasing our national guilt and
depravity.&nbsp; But these were considerations that weighed <a
name="page983"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 983</span>but little
with the minister and his associates.&nbsp; An increasing revenue
was with them of infinitely greater importance.&mdash;On the 2nd.
of June this year, a pleasure boat going off from <i>Heacham</i>
to a vessel lying in Lynn channel overset, and out of fourteen
persons, who were on board, men women and children, twelve
unfortunately perished.&mdash;This year also, from continued
rains, the harvest was not got in, in some parts of Norfolk till
the beginning of November; and in some parts of the kingdom some
corn lay rotting in the fields at the beginning of December: a
like instance had not occurred before for 40 or 50 years.</p>

</a></p>
<p>One of the most memorable of the Lynn occurrences in 1800, was
the taking down the <i>East-gates</i>, which had stood many
centuries, and made a somewhat venerable appearance.&nbsp; They
had been for sometime a subject of complaint on account of the
difficulty of entrance for highloaded waggons, by reason of the
lowness of the arch.&nbsp; This act of dilapidation therefore was
a case of necessity, and the removal of a nuisance, and it
rendered that entrance into the town much pleasanter than
before.&mdash;But an occurrence of this year which far more
affected the public mind, in this town, as well as throughout the
kingdom, was the regicide attempt of the maniac Hadfield on the
evening of the 15th. of May, at Drury Lane theatre.&nbsp; The
poor insane wretch fired a horse-pistol towards the king&rsquo;s
box just as his majesty entered it, but fortunately missed him,
owing it seems to a person near him, with great presence of mind,
raising <a name="page984"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
984</span>his arm when in the act of firing, and so directing the
contents of the pistol to the roof of the house.&nbsp; This
shocking deed occasioned no small consternation in the house; but
it soon subsided, and the play went on to the entire satisfaction
and amusement of the whole company, the royal family not
excepted.</p>
<p>The news of this horrid attempt upon the king&rsquo;s life,
and of his happy escape, deeply affected the minds of his Lynn
subjects, from whom no less than two addresses were soon after
presented to his majesty on the occasion; one from the mayor and
<i>corporation</i>, and the other from the mayor and the
<i>inhabitants</i>. <a name="citation984"></a><a
href="#footnote984" class="citation">[984]</a>&nbsp; Both of them
<a name="page985"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 985</span>were
penned in a language perfectly dutiful and loyal, which, without
doubt, was expressed with the utmost truth and sincerity.&nbsp;
The same may also be said of all the numerous addresses which
then reached the throne, from all quarters; which proves the
sovereign&rsquo;s great popularity, and how high he stood in the
estimation of his addressing subjects.&nbsp; His successor it is
to be hoped will prove himself no less deserving of his
people&rsquo;s attachment.</p>
<p>Since the year 1800, and the commencement of the present
century, nothing more remarkable is known to have occurred here
than what has been produced by the operation of new taxes and new
laws&mdash;especially our <i>poor</i> and <i>paving</i> laws. <a
name="citation985"></a><a href="#footnote985"
class="citation">[985]</a>&nbsp; These certainly have borne and
are still bearing hard upon a large portion of the industrious
inhabitants.&nbsp; Of these matters some notice has been taken
already, and they will probably be further noticed when we come
to give a view of the <i>present state</i> of the town.&nbsp;
Such remarkable occurrences as the author may be able to
recollect, or any one else may put him in mind of, as having been
overlooked in the preceding pages, shall be carefully inserted in
a <i>Chronological Table</i> at the end of the work.&mdash;Having
now brought this history down to <i>the present time</i>, we

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Biographical sketches of some of the most
eminent or distinguished personages among the natives or
inhabitants of Lynn</i>, <i>from the reformation to the present
day&mdash;Watts&mdash;Arrowsmith&mdash;Goodwin&mdash;Horne&mdash;Phelpes&mdash;Falkner&mdash;Goddard</i>.</p>
<p>In the list of persons of real note, or memorable distinction
who appeared since the reformation among the natives or
inhabitants of this town, the first place, in order of time,
seems to belong to <i>William Watts</i>, said to have been a
native of this borough, or its vicinity.&nbsp; The time of his
birth is not recorded, but is supposed to have been about the
close of the reign of Elizabeth.&nbsp; He probably received the
rudiments of his education in the Grammar school of this town,
which was from 1597 to 1608 under the care of <i>Mr. John
Man</i>, afterwards minister of South Lynn, and from 1608 to 1612
or 13, under that of <i>Mr. Henry Allston</i>.&nbsp; He was
afterwards sent to Caius College in Cambridge, where he appears
to have made great proficiency, and to have finished his
academical education.&nbsp; He then went and made some stay at
Oxford; after which he travelled, as Anthony Wood says, into
several countries, and became master of divers languages.&nbsp;
In his travels he is supposed to have made his chief stay in
Holland, where he became acquainted with the celebrated <i>John
Gerard Vossius</i>, who entertained a very favourable and high
opinion of him, and spoke of him as <i>doctissimus et clarissimus
Watsius</i>, <i>qui optime de historia meruit</i>.&nbsp; At his
return, after the accession of Charles I, he was made one of the
king&rsquo;s chaplains, and preferred successively to livings and
dignities in the church.&nbsp; Being, as might <a
name="page987"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 987</span>be
expected, a zealous royalist, and adhering firmly to the
king&rsquo;s cause, he was sequestered, plundered, and left
without a shelter for his wife and children.&nbsp; He was carried
by his courage and resentment into the field with prince Rupert,
during the hardiest of his exploits; and died, in 1649, on board
his fleet, in the harbour of Kinsale.&nbsp; He had an especial
hand, says Wood, in Sir Henry Spelman&rsquo;s Glossary; he edited
Matthew Paris, and, exclusively of other treatises, he published,
before the civil war of England began, several numbers of new
books, in the English tongue, (more than forty,) containing the
occurrences in the wars between the king of Sweden and the
Germans.&nbsp; When he returned from his travels, Newspapers were
very little known in this country.&nbsp; They had first appeared
in the reign of Elizabeth, under the sage direction of Burleigh;
but they were published only occasionally, and were all
extraordinary gazettes.&nbsp; They appeared frequently about the
time of the armada, and are supposed to have then answered very
important purposes.&nbsp; Being no longer deemed necessary when
that danger was past, they were discontinued.&nbsp; The public
curiosity having been much gratified by these publications, the
people would be no longer satisfied without a newspaper.&nbsp; It
was therefore not long before publications of that kind began to
make their appearance.&nbsp; They were at first occasional, and
afterwards weekly.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Nathaniel Butter</i>, at the
Pyde-Bull, St. Augustin&rsquo;s gate,&rdquo; established a weekly
newspaper, in August 1622, entitled &ldquo;The certain news of
the present week.&rdquo;&nbsp; How long he continued his
hebdomadal intelligences does not appear.&nbsp; He is said <a
name="page988"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 988</span>to have
laid little before his readers, which could enlarge knowledge, or
excite risibility; though his battles may have surprised and
elevated, and his sieges may have alternately agitated the hopes
and fears of his countrymen.&nbsp; He had, however, competitors
and imitators.&nbsp; In February 1635&ndash;6 was first published
a fresh paper of Weekly Newes.&nbsp; The foreign intelligence of
May 22, was conveyed in number 13.&nbsp; This too was a small
quarto of 14 pages; and it was printed in London, for Mercurius
Britannicus; which proves sufficiently that that well known title
had a more early origin than has been generally supposed.&nbsp;
Similar papers were continued, though they assumed different
names.&nbsp; Butter, who appears to have been the most active and
enterprising newsmonger of his time, was influenced by his
interest to tell&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;News, old news, and such news as you never
heard of.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was thus induced to convert his Weekly News into
<i>half-yearly news</i>, (two of which making a kind of <i>annual
register</i>) which shews that he was a person of no common
enterprize.&nbsp; In order to insure success to so novel an
undertaking, an able compiler seemed absolutely necessary; and
Butter very judiciously fixed upon Watts for that
department.&nbsp; He accordingly complied with the
projector&rsquo;s proposal, and so became the precursor of
<i>Johnson</i>, <i>Burke</i>, <i>Kippis</i>, <i>Southey</i>, and
the rest of our distinguished literary characters, who have been
since employed in similar departments.&nbsp; How long he
continued thus employed we have not been able to discover; but it
is probably it might be till near the <a name="page989"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 989</span>commencement of the civil wars: and
as he was likely to have distinguished himself, in the mean time,
as a warm, and perhaps violent advocate for the measures of the
court, it may in some measure account for the hardship and
severity which he and his family afterwards experienced from the
opposite party, by the hands of the sequestrators.&nbsp; Be that
as it might, William Watts was certainly a person so
distinguished in his day, as to deserve to have his name
preserved among the most eminent characters that sprung up here
during the period we are now reviewing.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <i>John Arrowsmith</i> M.A. Fellow of Catherine Hall,
in Cambridge, afterwards D.D., Master of St. John&rsquo;s
College, and member of the Westminster Assembly of Divines.&nbsp;
Where he was born we have not been able to learn; but he came to
this town about Michaelmas 1630, being then chosen minister of
St. Nicholas&rsquo; chapel, in which capacity he continued during
the whole time of his residence here, which was fourteen
years.&nbsp; The town allowed him a salary of 100<i>l.</i> a
year, which must have been equal to 6 or 700<i>l.</i> of our
money.&nbsp; He was also allowed a house to live in, or
5<i>l.</i> a year in lieu of it, which would pay a house-rent now
of between 30 and 40<i>l.</i> a year.&nbsp; It appears that he
was treated here, during the whole of his residence, with
singular and universal respect; from which it may be inferred
that he came well recommended, conducted himself with great
prudence and propriety, and that his ministerial labours were
highly acceptable.&nbsp; Yet Arrowsmith evidently belonged to the
puritans, a party <a name="page990"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
990</span>for which Lynn was never understood to entertain any
particular predilection.&nbsp; How far his ministry contributed
to prepare the town for the new order of things which took place
in consequence of the siege, and with which the generality of the
inhabitants appeared very compliable, we have not the means of
ascertaining.&nbsp; But whatever might be the political tendency
of his public labours here, their being highly acceptable to his
hearers seems very clear and undeniable.&nbsp; For though he and
the principal cotemporary minister of St. Margaret&rsquo;s had
several assistants, <a name="citation990a"></a><a
href="#footnote990a" class="citation">[990a]</a> who performed
the parts assigned to them on Sundays and week days with good
acceptance, yet the present writer has in his hands sufficient
documents <a name="citation990b"></a><a href="#footnote990b"
class="citation">[990b]</a> to prove <a name="page991"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 991</span>that he stood above them all in the
public estimation.&nbsp; It is therefore presumed that we are
fully warranted in placing him among the most eminent of the
inhabitants <a name="page992"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
992</span>of this town during the said period.&nbsp; The
historian Neal speaks of him as a person &ldquo;of
unexceptionable character for learning and piety;&rdquo; and
further says, that &ldquo;he was an accute disputant, and a
judicious divine, as appears by his <i>Tactica Sacra</i>, a book
of great reputation in those times.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died before
the restoration, and therefore his name does not appear in
<i>Calamy</i> and <i>Rastrick&rsquo;s lists of ejected
ministers</i>.</p>
<p>Before we take our final leave of Dr. Arrowsmith, it may not
be improper to apprize the reader of two persons <a
name="page993"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 993</span>whom the
town successively fixed upon to occupy the vacant place of
principal minister of St. Nicholas, immediately previous to their
making choice of him.&nbsp; These, as appears to the present
writer, were no other than the two <i>Goodwins</i>, <i>Thomas</i>
and <i>John</i>, who became so famous and distinguished
afterwards among the English nonconformists.&nbsp; In a document
or record above alluded to, and extracted probably from the
Hall-Books, the following passage occurs.&mdash;&ldquo;1629, 12
June; Mr. Mayor and Mr. Tho. Gurlyn, aldn. travel to Cambridge to
move Mr. Tho. Goodwin A.M. to come hither to (be) preacher in ys
town, and Mr. M. A. CC elected sd.&nbsp; Mr. G. if he will accept
thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he did not accept of their invitation,
owing probably to his having been previously chosen lecturer of
Trinity church in Cambridge, of which he afterwards became vicar.
<a name="citation993"></a><a href="#footnote993"
class="citation">[993]</a></p>
<p>Having failed in their application to him, their next choice
fell on John Goodwin, afterwards, if we are not mistaken, the
noted minister of Coleman street, and the far-famed champion of
arminianism and republicanism.&nbsp; He also was a Cambridge man,
and had been Fellow of Queen&rsquo;s College ever since
1617.&nbsp; He and Tho. Goodwin were both Norfolk men, and also
near relations, if the present writer is not misinformed.&nbsp;
But surely no two <a name="page994"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
994</span>relations&mdash;not even Herbert Marsh and William
Frend, could be more unlike one another.&nbsp; Thomas was a high
supralapsarian Calvinist, and, of course, mortally hated
Arminianism: John, on the other hand, was a decided Arminian, and
one of its most redoubtable champions; and therefore held
Calvinism in the utmost abhorrence.&nbsp; His firm and successful
opposition to that system is said to have saved him at the
restoration from utter ruin, in which his antimonarchical and
republican productions would have inevitably involved him, when
one or more of his books, together with some of
<i>Milton&rsquo;s</i>, were burnt by the common hangman:&mdash;a
poor way, by the bye, to refute their contents, or arguments.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <i>John Goodwin</i> when invited to Lynn held the
living of <i>Rainham</i> in the same county: yet he accepted that
invitation, took up his residence here, and became the successor
of Mr. Nic. Price, as chief minister of St. Nicholas&rsquo;
chapel.&nbsp; But his settlement here was not long, scarcely
exceeding one year; for he was chosen July 31. 1629&mdash;acceded
to that choice on the 10th of the next month, and within a year,
or very little more, from that period, he was, as the MS. says,
<i>inhibited for preaching here</i>, [by the <i>bishop</i> we
presume; but <i>on</i> what account does not appear;] and Dr.
Arrowsmith was appointed to succeed him, at the michaelmas
following, i.e. 1630, for further particulars concerning him, the
reader is referred to the historians of the succeeding period,
and to our general biographers. <a name="citation994"></a><a
href="#footnote994" class="citation">[994]</a>&nbsp; With all his
singularities <a name="page995"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
995</span>and imperfections, he must have been in his day a very
considerable and highly distinguished character.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <i>John Horne</i>&mdash;was another of our townsmen
of former times, whose name deserves to be rescued from oblivion,
and retained in the memory of the inhabitants.&nbsp; He was born
at <i>Long Sutton</i>, <i>Lincolnshire</i>, in 1615; and educated
at Trinity College in Cambridge, where he had Henry Hall B.D. for
his tutor.&nbsp; He probably went into orders before 1640; and we
are told that he <i>preached first at Sutton St. James</i>, in
his native neighbourhood.&nbsp; It has been also supposed that he
had afterwards a curacy at or near <i>Bullingbrook</i>, in the
same county, and it seems somewhat probable that he married
during his residence at that place. <a name="citation995"></a><a
href="#footnote995" class="citation">[995]</a>&nbsp; Be that as
<a name="page996"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 996</span>it
might, it is certain that his stay there was not very long, for
he took up his residence at Lynn in 1646, <a
name="citation996"></a><a href="#footnote996"
class="citation">[996]</a> where he continued ever after to the
day of his death, <a name="page997"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
997</span>which was full thirty years.&nbsp; His coming hither
was in consequence of having obtained the living or vicarage of
Allhallows, or All-saints, in South Lynn, where he succeeded Mr.
<i>John Man</i>, whom we noticed before, at p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page702">702</a></span> of this
work, and who had resided here, first as <i>usher</i>, then
<i>master</i> of the Grammar School, and afterwards as <i>vicar
of South Lynn</i>, for the long space of between 50 and 60 years.
<a name="citation997a"></a><a href="#footnote997a"
class="citation">[997a]</a></p>
<p>Having obtained the vicarage of South Lynn Allhallows, in
1646, Mr. H. continued in the faithful and diligent discharge of
his duty there till 1662, when the <i>act of uniformity</i>,
which took effect on <i>Bartholomew day</i> that year, <a
name="citation997b"></a><a href="#footnote997b"
class="citation">[997b]</a> rendered his situation there no
longer tenable.&nbsp; He was then ejected from his vicarage of
Allhallows in this town, as were also above 2000 worthy clergymen
in different parts of the kingdom, to the great discouragement of
integrity and piety, and the eternal disgrace of the rulers in
church and state.&nbsp; A very respectable biographer and
memorialist speaks of Mr. Horne as follows&mdash;&ldquo;He was an
<i>Arminian</i> in the point of redemption, and contended
earnestly for the universality <a name="page998"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 998</span>of it; but did not either believe or
teach, that men may therefore live as they list, because Christ
died for them; but taught that Christ therefore &lsquo;died for
all, that they which live should no longer live unto themselves,
but unto him that died for them and rose again.&rsquo; 2 Cor. v.
14, 15.&nbsp; He was a man of most exemplary and primitive piety,
and blameless conversation; very ready in the scriptures;
excellently skilled in the oriental tongues, and very laborious
in his private capacity after he was cast out of his
living.&nbsp; He went constantly to church, and yet preached
<i>thrice</i> at his own house every Lord&rsquo;s day; first, in
the morning before sermon; then after dinner, before church-time;
and again in the evening.&nbsp; On the other days of the week,
beside lecture-sermons, he constantly expounded the scriptures in
order twice a day, to all that would come to hear him, as some
always did. <a name="citation998"></a><a href="#footnote998"
class="citation">[998]</a>&nbsp; He was a man of great charity,
commonly emptying his pocket of what money he had in it amongst
the poor, when he went into the town.&nbsp; He was of great
compassion and tenderheartedness towards such as were in any
affliction; a man of wonderfull meekness, patience, and
dispassionateness; and was generally very much honoured and
esteemed for his goodness, both in town and country.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We need no further proof of his being held here in high and
general esteem, than that he was suffered to live in the town,
and exercise his ministry, for the whole fourteen years he
resided here after his ejection, and which was perhaps the very
worst <a name="page999"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
999</span>part of the persecuting and detestable reign of Charles
II.&nbsp; Some old people used to say some years ago, that his
lecturing or preaching place was in some obscure alley about
Black-goose Street.&nbsp; However that was, Mr. Horne may justly
be considered as the <i>father of the Lynn Dissenters</i>: nor
need they be ashamed to own him as such.&nbsp; Beside his other
labours, which were so very abundant, his labours as a
<i>writer</i> were by no means inconsiderable.&nbsp; Mr.
<i>Palmer</i> has preserved the titles of <i>near thirty
publications</i>, of different sizes, of which he was the author;
<a name="citation999"></a><a href="#footnote999"
class="citation">[999]</a> which shews how active he was in
employing his pen, as well as his tongue, in promoting what he
deemed useful and profitable instruction.&nbsp; On the whole, it
may be pretty safely concluded that such a union of
laboriousness, conscientiousness, and piety, as appeared in the
person of Mr. Horne, was scarce ever witnessed in any minister of
this town, either before or since his time.&nbsp; His memory
therefore ought to be very highly honoured.&nbsp; He died here on
the 14th of December 1676, aged 61.&nbsp; His wife survived him
near ten years.&nbsp; She died May 24. 1686, aged 73.&nbsp; <a
name="page1000"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1000</span>What
family they had we are unable to say.&nbsp; One Son, named
<i>Thomas</i>, died about two years before the father, at the age
of 28: and we are inclined to think there was another son, of
both the father&rsquo;s names, who long survived his parents, and
that this son was no other than the afterwards famous master of
the Lynn grammar school, who may be justly called <i>the Dr.
Busby of this town</i>.&nbsp; That he exercised over his pupils
so severe a discipline as that of the celebrated master of
Westminster School, is what we will not take upon us to
affirm&mdash;nor yet that he educated an equal number of eminent
men; but in the assiduity with which he executed his charge there
must have been a strong resemblance, and especially in the length
of time he continued at the head of his seminary, for he held the
mastership of the Lynn grammar school upwards of fifty
years.&nbsp; He must therefore have been notable and eminent in
his day among the inhabitants of this town.&nbsp; On which
account, whether he was the son of the former John Horne, or not,
he is entitled to some notice in the present list.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; <i>John Horne junr.</i> A.M. (of the University of
Cambridge, as it is supposed) was born in 1644.&nbsp; So that in
case he was the son of the former, he must have been born about
two years before his father settled in this town, which will very
well agree with the former supposition, of his being previously
married, while he resided at, or near Bullingbrook.&nbsp; After
he left the university, the subject of the present article was
for some time <i>usher</i> of the Grammar School at Norwich, <a
name="page1001"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1001</span>whence he
was invited to become <i>master</i> of that at Lynn.&nbsp; This
was in 1678: whereupon he removed hither, and continued at the
head of this school above 50 years; so that it may pretty safely
be concluded that he educated a far greater number of pupils than
any other master in this town.&nbsp; He died in 1732. aged 88,
and was buried in St. Nicholas&rsquo; chapel, close to the grave
of the other John Horne; which, together with his refraining from
going into orders, may corroborate the opinion of his being the
son of that worthy and memorable man. <a
name="citation1001a"></a><a href="#footnote1001a"
class="citation">[1001a]</a>&nbsp; However that was, he appears
to have been a person of a very respectable character, who
faithfully served his generation, and deserved well of his
cotemporaries and of posterity; <a name="citation1001b"></a><a
href="#footnote1001b" class="citation">[1001b]</a> which, it is
to be feared, is more than can be said of all, or every one of
his successors.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; <i>Charles Phelpes</i>.&nbsp; In point of time he
ought to have been placed before the last, being his senior, by
near twenty years.&nbsp; But as the former was supposed to be the
son of the preceding, it was thought proper to let his name
immediately follow.&nbsp; The subject of this article, if not a
relation, was yet an intimate friend of the elder Horne, and
perhaps an occasional assistant to him in the ministry; but of
this there is no clear proof.&nbsp; Nor is it at all certain that
he afterwards ever <a name="page1002"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1002</span>officiated in the congregation as a
public teacher. <a name="citation1002a"></a><a
href="#footnote1002a" class="citation">[1002a]</a>&nbsp; All we
know of him is, that he was a person eminently distinguished here
in his day for his religious knowledge, his benevolence, and his
piety, which he strove unweariedly to promote by his example, his
conversation, and his writings. <a name="citation1002b"></a><a
href="#footnote1002b" class="citation">[1002b]</a>&nbsp; In
short, he was a blessing to the town, and one of that sort of men
that may not improperly be called the &ldquo;salt of the
earth,&rdquo; to whose benevolent and pious exertions we owe
almost every thing truly good and valuable that is to be found
amongst us.&nbsp; He was therefore clearly entitled to a place in
this list, or biographical sketch.&nbsp; He died on 3rd of
January 1711 in the 85th. year of his age, as we learn from his
grave stone to St. Nicholas&rsquo; Church yard, over against the
great South door, where it is said, and said truly no doubt, that
he was &ldquo;a person of exemplary piety and
goodness.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have heard that he was great uncle to
the late vicar of South Lynn of the same name, who, though of
inferior worth, was yet far from being one of the worst sort of
clergymen.</p>
<p><a name="page1003"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1003</span>7.&nbsp; <i>Guybon Goddard</i>.&nbsp; We hear of him
first as <i>Deputy Recorder</i> of this borough, in 1645, under
the memorable Miles Corbet, who had been chosen Recorder the
preceding year.&nbsp; Goddard continued his deputy till 1650, or
rather till the beginning of the ensuing year, when he succeeded
to the recordership, as appears from the following passage in the
Hall-books.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jan. 31. 1650, 51; This day Mr. Mayor
and aldermen have elected and chosen in the place of Miles
Corbet, Esq. (called by the Parliament to the service of Ireland)
<i>Guybon Goddard</i> Esq. Recorder, provided always, that he,
accepting of the place, shall come and inhabit in this town, for
the better assistance of the succeeding mayors with his advice
and councell.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be supposed that he took up his
residence here accordingly.&nbsp; However that might be, it seems
he retained the place over after, and executed the duties,
attached to it with much credit to himself, and to the
satisfaction of the body corporate and the rest the
community.&nbsp; He was doubtless very good lawyer, but more
distinguished perhaps as an antiquary, to which pursuit he was
much devoted, in which his acquirements we supposed to have been
very considerable.&nbsp; His brother-in-law, <i>Sir William
Dugdale</i>, and <i>Parkin</i> also, make honourable mention of
his antiquarian attainments, <a name="citation1003"></a><a
href="#footnote1003" class="citation">[1003]</a> and is such a
case they <a name="page1004"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1004</span>must have been very competent judges.&nbsp; To
archaiological objects in the adjacent and surrounding country he
paid much attention, and still more to those that appertained to
this town, his collection for a history of which is supposed to
have been very complete, and excited for a long while very high
expectation among his cotemporaries.&nbsp; But they were all
sadly disappointed; for it was never suffered to see the light:
and though the corporation, after his decease, endeavoured to
procure it from his son, and offered for it what must have been
at that time a handsome gratuity; yet it does not appear that
they were able to obtain it.&nbsp; What became of it afterwards
no one can tell: but it is most probable that it has long ago
been irretrievably lost.&nbsp; Had it been preserved, and fallen
into the present writer&rsquo;s hands, it might (as was hinted at
p. <span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page821">821</a></span>,)
have rendered this work far more worthy than it now is of the
public patronage.&nbsp; In Parkin&rsquo;s History of Freebridge
(p. 293,) the death of Goddard is placed in 1671, which we
suspect to be a mistake for 1677, as the application to his son
was made about the beginning of the next year; and it is not
likely it would have been deferred for so long a time as seven
years.&nbsp; However that was Guybon Goddard seems clearly
entitled to have his name enrolled among the memorable men of
Lynn.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; <i>William Falkner</i>, <i>D.D.</i>&mdash;He came to
this town in 1658, recommended by Dr. Arrowsmith and Dr. Tuckney,
and was engaged as an assistant to Mr. Hoogan, <a
name="page1005"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1005</span>who had
succeeded Dr. A. as senior or principal minister of St.
Nicholas&rsquo; Chapel.&nbsp; Falkner was then Fellow of
Peter-house in Cambridge; so that there is no reason to suppose
him the same as that <i>William Falconer</i>, <i>M.A. of
Aberdeen</i>, whom, according to <i>Granger</i>, <i>Wood</i> in
his Fasti mentions, under 1671, as incorporated into the
University of Oxford, and one of the first exhibitioners at
Baliol College.&nbsp; At the death or removal of Mr. Hoogan, F.
appears to have succeeded him as chief minister, and in that
situation he is supposed to have continued ever after; though,
considering the prominent appearance he made among his brethren,
it is not likely that he was left without other
preferments.&nbsp; His residence here was about 24 years.&nbsp;
He died April, 9. 1682: nor does it appear that he was then an
old man; about 50, perhaps, or very little more.&nbsp; We have
not been able to learn the character of his public ministry and
pastoral labours, or how far he therein resembled Horne, or
Arrowsmith.&nbsp; But, as a scholar and writer, he must have
stood high among the Lynn clergy, and even among those of the
whole diocese; for he was very learned, and his writings for the
most part, were well calculated to render him famous among his
brethren, and gain him the approbation and applause of the
highest dignitaries of the church, and the chief functionaries of
the state, or civil government.&nbsp; For passive obedience and
non-resistance, and the whole tory system, then the darling
doctrine of the clergy and the court, he was a warm and able
advocate.&nbsp; Nor was he less so for the church of England,
against the Romanists, on the one hand, <a
name="page1006"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1006</span>and our
protestant sectaries, on the other.&nbsp; How he would have
stood, had he lived a few years longer, or till the eve of the
revolution, it is impossible to say.&nbsp; But it is certain that
many, who were to the full as torified as he in the reign of
Charles, changed their minds and their tones greatly during that
of his successor, so as to caress as friends and brethren, those
very sectaries and schismatics, as they used to call them, whom
they had before endeavoured with all their might to distress and
crush.&nbsp; That Dr. F. would have done the same, had he lived
so long, is more than we are warranted to affirm, through we
would fain hope that such would have been the case.&mdash;Among
the books of which he was the author were several pieces of
divinity, which first perhaps appeared separately, but were in
1684, two years after his death, printed together in a quarto
volume.&nbsp; As it has never fallen in our way, we can say
nothing of its merits.&nbsp; But his principal publications seem
to be the following; 1. <i>Libertas Ecclesiastica</i>, an english
octavo volume, published in 1674, and spoken of, by Granger, as a
book of merit.&nbsp; 2. A <i>vindication of Liturgies</i>, or set
forms of prayer: printed in London in 1680.&nbsp; This was
animadverted upon and answered by the memorable <i>Dr.
Collinges</i> of Norwich, an eminent ejected Minister,
<i>first</i> in a piece entitled, &ldquo;A reasonable account of
the judgment of nonconforming ministers, as to prescribed forms
of prayer; with a supplement in Answer to Dr. Falkner of
Liturgies;&rdquo; and afterwards in another piece, entitled,
&ldquo;The vindication of Liturgies, lately published by Dr.
Falkner, proved no vindication, &amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; 3.
<i>Christian Loyalty</i>: or a <a name="page1007"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1007</span>discourse, wherein is asserted that
just Royal Authority and Eminency which in this Church and Realm
of <i>England</i> is yielded to the <span
class="GutSmall">KING</span>.&nbsp; Especially concerning
<i>supremacy</i> in <i>Causes Ecclesiastical</i>.&nbsp; Together
with the disclaiming of all <i>Foreign Jurisdictions</i> and the
unlawfulness of Subjects <span class="GutSmall">TAKING
ARMS</span> against the <span class="smcap">King</span>.&nbsp;
This is a most notable production, and it seems not a little
unaccountable that it did not immediately procure him a
mitre.&nbsp; It is much in the way of Sir Robert Filmer, and the
rest of our great Tory-writers, and scarcely inferior to the very
best of them.&nbsp; It was printed in London in 1679, and again,
it seems, in 1684, which shews that it was well approved of and
sought for.&nbsp; Dr. Falkner dying, as was said, in 1682, was
succeeded at St. Nicholas&rsquo; by a <i>Mr. Killeingbeck</i>, of
whom we have heard nothing further.</p>

<p>9.&nbsp; <i>Thomas Littel</i>, <i>D.D.</i>&nbsp; He is
supposed to have settled here, as one of our officiating clergy,
pretty soon after the revolution; but whether as vicar and
principal minister of the town, or as Lecturer, or in <a
name="page1008"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1008</span>an
inferior station as the Vicar&rsquo;s curate, we cannot
positively say.&nbsp; It is certain however that he soon
succeeded as vicar or chief minister of the town, and continued
in that situation for a great many years.&nbsp; Though a Doctor
in Divinity, he is supposed not to have stood high among his
brethren and contemporaries as a scholar, a preacher, or as a
divine; but there were traits in his character that were of no
unamiable cast, especially in regard to his attention to the
edification of the common people.&nbsp; In more recent times he
would probably have been deemed a methodistical clergyman, which
is not mentioned here as dishonourable to his memory, but rather
the contrary, as it is the opinion of the present writer, that if
a <i>reasonable portion</i> of methodism were imbibed by the
clergy, it would render their ministry more popular, and prove of
material advantage to the lower orders of their auditors.&nbsp;
In Dr. Littel&rsquo;s time, a great many of his hearers, of the
poorer classes, as it would seem, became desirous of improving
themselves in religious knowledge; and the course that appeared
to them most likely, or the best for attaining that object was to
establish private meetings for free discussion, or serious
conference.&nbsp; Whether they had been led to this from
something of the kind that existed among their dissenting
neighbours here, we are not able to say; but it is certain that
such exercises are much more common among dissenters than among
churchmen.&nbsp; However that was, it seems they were not
disposed to put the plan in practice without consulting Dr.
Littel, who was then vicar of St. Margaret&rsquo;s and chief
minister of the town: and it does not appear that <a
name="page1009"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1009</span>he urged
any material objection, or gave them any serious
discouragement.&nbsp; But he was aware that it would not be safe
or proper for him to countenance such a measure without the
privity and permission of his diocesan.&nbsp; He accordingly
applied to <i>Dr. Moore</i>, who then filled the see of Norwich,
and who, in his answer, dated September 10. 1697, appeared no way
hostile to the measure, provided it were properly conducted;
though he said, however friendly he might be to the design, yet
he did not find he had any power by law to constitute and
authorize such assemblies.&nbsp; Nevertheless he consented to
allow the experiment to be here tried, under certain
regulations.&nbsp; This episcopal letter is on the whole a very
curious document, and not dishonourable to his lordship&rsquo;s
memory; but it is too long for insertion here.&nbsp; He cautioned
them to avoid all discussions about state affairs, and whatever
might tend to give umbrage to government; and he advised them to
meet in small rather than large companies: which advice was
probably adhered to.&nbsp; However that was, the intended measure
was soon put in practice.&nbsp; For six or seven years the
meetings seem to have been kept in private houses, under certain
general regulations.&nbsp; But in 1704 the plan was further
matured, new rules of conference were drawn up, <a
name="citation1010"></a><a href="#footnote1010"
class="citation">[1010]</a> <a name="page1010"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1010</span>and the meetings afterwards were
generally if not constantly kept in the Vestry of St.
Margaret&rsquo;s Church, till the death of Dr. Littel, which
happened in 1732.&nbsp; <a name="page1011"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1011</span>The Society then languished and
dwindled away, so that in the year 1744 it was reduced to six
members, whose names were Colins Banister, James Cowell, Joshua
Edwards <a name="page1012"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1012</span>senr. Adam Holditch, John Lee, and William Rayns: It
appears to have been dissolved soon after, having existed about
fifty years; and for a long time no memorial of it remained,
except in some old papers which fell into the present
writer&rsquo;s hands accidentally.&nbsp; This Society had formed
a library, a catalogue of which it also in this writer&rsquo;s
possession.&nbsp; What became of the books at last, does not
appear.&nbsp; We know of nothing more creditable to the memory of
Dr Littel, than the countenance he afforded to those serious
people.&nbsp; It is supposed that his successor in the Vicarage
of St. Margaret did not also succeed him as the patron of this
Institution.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; <i>Thomas Pyle M.A.</i>&nbsp; Of the birth-place and
the early part of the life of the rev. T. Pyle, whose name is
still mentioned with veneration by the few who remember him as a
preacher, we have not been able to obtain any account.&nbsp; So
rapid is the neglect or the forgetfulness of oral
tradition!&nbsp; From his epitaph we learn indeed that he was
born in 1674.&nbsp; About the year 1698, he was examined for
ordination, at Norwich, by the celebrated and truly honest
William Whiston, at that time chaplain to bishop Moore, who has
stated in the interesting Memoirs of his Life, that Dr. Sydal and
Mr. Pyle were the best scholars among the many candidates whom it
was his office to examine.&nbsp; It is probable that he was
ordained upon the title of one of the curacies of St
Margaret&rsquo;s parish, as he married, in <a
name="page1013"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1013</span>1701, a
Mrs Mary Rolfe of an affluent and respectable family in Lynn, and
in the same year he was appointed by the Corporation to be
minister or preacher of St. Nicholas&rsquo; Chapel.&nbsp; He
published some political Sermons in the years 1706, 1707. and
especially in the year 1715.&nbsp; In these discourses he
vindicated and enforced those principles to which we are indebted
for the expulsion of the Stuarts, and for the elevation of the
Brunswick family to the throne.&nbsp; About the same period he
became generally known as the author of a very useful Paraphrase
on the Historical Books of the Old Testament, and another on the
Acts, the Epistles and the Revelation of the New Testament.&nbsp;
Soon afterwards he enlisted himself as a writer in the Bangorian
Controversy, and was a strenuous and able advocate of the civil
and religious principles of Bp. Hoadly.&nbsp; He appears to have
been on terms of particular friendship with some of the greatest
and best men in the Church of England, such as Dr. Sam. Clarke,
Mr. Jackson of Leicester, Dr. Sykes, Bp. Hoadly, Dr. Herring,
afterwards abp. of Canterbury; and equally so with some eminent
dissenting ministers, particularly Dr. Sam. Chandler and Mr.
Rastrick of Lynn.&nbsp; Many years after his death his youngest
son, the rev. Philip Pyle, published several volumes of his
&ldquo;Sermons on plain and practical Subjects.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
writings are characterised by a perspicuity and manly sense,
rather than by any elevation of style, or by a graceful
negligence; and yet in the delivery of his sermons, so impressive
was his elocution, that both in the metropolis and in the
country, he was one of the most admired <a
name="page1014"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1014</span>preachers
of his time.&nbsp; The flowing lines were sent to him on his
Sermon preached at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, May 4th. 1735, on Gen.
III, 19.</p>

<p>With such talents, and with such connections, it cannot easily
be accounted for, that Mr. Pyle should remain during so long a
life in a situation of comparative obscurity.&nbsp; Sir Robert
Walpole was the member for Lynn; and both the political and
religious opinions of Mr. Pyle were calculated to recommend him
to queen Caroline, who then impartially dispensed the dignities
of the Church.&nbsp; Perhaps the spirit of the man was not
thought sufficiently accommodating for an introduction to a
court; or, like the late Dr. Ogden of Cambridge, from some
deficiency of external polish, he might be deemed not
producible.&nbsp; A passage in Abp. Herring&rsquo;s
Correspondence with Mr. Duncombe seems to be decisive on this
point.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tom Pyle is a learned and worthy, as well as
a lively and entertaining man.&nbsp; To be sure his success has
not been equal to his merit, which yet, perhaps, is in some
measure owing to himself; for that very impetuosity of spirit,
which, under proper government, renders him the agreeable
creature he is, has, in some circumstances of life, got the
better of him, and hurt his views.&rdquo; <a

class="citation">[1015a]</a>&nbsp; From whatever cause, <a
name="page1016"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1016</span>with the
exception of a Prebend of Salisbury, which he received from Bp.
Hoadly, he was only in succession Lecturer and Minister of Lynn
St. Margaret, and vicar of Lynn All-saints&mdash;all truly but a
poor and paltry pittance for such a man, and from a church which
had such immense abundance of good things to bestow; most of
which too were actually bestowed on far unworthier
objects.&mdash;The following Letters which passed between Mr.
Pyle and Abp. Herring are highly characteristic and
interesting.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My Lord,</p>
<p>In the universal acclamation of joy for your Grace&rsquo;s
promotion to the Primacy of all England, may the feeble voice of
an old man be heard, the short remainder of whose life, will pass
off with a pleasure that nothing could have given, but seeing at
the head of the Church, a Prelate so affectionately attached to
the interests of Truth, Virtue, and Liberty.</p>

it sha&rsquo;nt make me ungrateful or unmindful of my Friends,

1018</span>From the part which Mr. P. took in the Bangorian

was known to live with Bp. Hoadly, we may be very sure that there
subsisted between them a frequent correspondence.&nbsp; Copies of

(and said it should be my last) petition to you, begging of you
to be pleased to bestow on him a living that might consist with

good liking, and out of the esteem she has long had for me and

propose him as a H. for her niece, the only child of Mr.
Arrowsmith: such a proposal from one who can and will make a
considerable addition to the very good fortune that the young
lady&rsquo;s father can give her, is a great proof of her esteem
for my son, who has been much with her from his childhood: and
what she requires on my part is that I use my interest in your
lordship, and mention her as joining with me to beg of you to
confer a handsome living on my Son.&nbsp; This will crown all the
instances of your beneficence towards me.&mdash;I want words to
express the joy with which a happy success in this affair would
carry me thro&rsquo; the small remainder of my life, and make me
yield it up to its bounteous Author; or to describe the tearing
anxiety that would accompany a disappointment from your refusing
what I humbly ask.&mdash;Wherefore I beg of your lordship to make
me feel the beginning of that satisfaction I have already in view
by such a reply to this petition as may be pleasing to the
excellent friends I am herein concerned with, and so highly
obliged to, and to the heart of an old servant who has loved you

<p>You cannot rejoice more sincerely at any good that falls on
any part of your family than I do: tho&rsquo; you may feel it
more paternally.&nbsp; In answer to what you propose, I first <a
name="page1020"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1020</span>say that
I was 75 years old on the 14th of last November.&nbsp; What may
happen God only knows.&nbsp; But if it shd be both physically and

unknown, only by report) and for Mr. Arrowsmith, to whose
faithful services and exemplary behaviour I was long ago a
witness at Stretham, will not at all abate but increase the
inclination.&nbsp; I cannot suppose that by what you say you can
mean such a living as would make void M&mdash;lksham which your

<a name="citation1020"></a><a href="#footnote1020"

hardly obtained; but one that would be an handsome addition to

in my patronage.&nbsp; But you must remember that when you
mentioned your request for your son Ph. first, I told you of
engagements, and I now tell you that since that, I have not had
one vacancy, as far as I can recollect, of a living in Wilts of
about 130<i>l.</i> per annum.&nbsp; I think myself obliged to
speak plainly, that nothing may be expected from me that I cannot
pretend to perform.&nbsp; I have, and have had, for some years,
two absolute engagements upon me for two of my best livings or
such of a secondary sort as will be accepted of till better
fall.&nbsp; And I am very sure, you are not the man that would
say a single word to me towards the immorality of falshood or
breach of promise.&nbsp; And I have the very same opinion of the
goodness of heart of those worthy persons who have entered into
this affair with you.&nbsp; As to actual vacancies, it is our
duty not to wish for any by death.&nbsp; And they are very
uncertain, <a name="page1021"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

life, tho&rsquo; my health is surprisingly better than it was in
my younger days.&nbsp; With all these considerations of my age,

<p>Mr. Pyle, as was said before, obtained the lectureship, and
became the preacher at St. Nicholas&rsquo; chapel, and one of the
ministers of the town in 1701.&nbsp; In that situation he
continued till 1732, when he succeeded Dr. Littel as vicar of St.
Margaret&rsquo;s.&nbsp; This situation he held till 1755, being
no longer capable of discharging the duties annexed to it.&nbsp;
He accordingly gave in his resignation, both to the Dean and
Chapter of Norwich, and also to the Mayor and corporation of
Lynn, early in the Summer of that year.&nbsp; How his resignation
to the former was worded we know not, but his resignation to the
latter, of which we have obtained a <a name="page1022"></a><span

Lynn.&nbsp; But I cannot nor ought to do this, without paying my

<p>This Letter is supposed to have been dated from
<i>Swaffham</i>, where, on account of its healthy situation, he
resided the two last years of his life; and where, if we are not
mistaken, he also died on the last day of the ensuing year.&nbsp;
He was buried in the Church of Lynn All-Saints, where a latin
epitaph honourable to their memories, is inscribed on the stone
that covers the <a name="page1023"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1023</span>remains of him and his wife.&nbsp; She died the 14th
of March 1748, aged 66: and he died the 31st. of December 1756,
aged 82.&nbsp; This was 58 years after the commencement of his
ministry.&nbsp; He was succeeded in his pastoral charge at Lynn
by the late <i>Charles Bagge D.D.</i> whose ministerial as well
as literary character must have been widely different from his;
and yet it does not seem to have made any mighty difference as to
the audience, who, it is presumed, went on much as before,
praising the successor in terms very similar to those they had
been wont to apply to his predecessor.&nbsp; Thus it often
happens after the departure of eminent men, both in the church
and in dissenting congregations.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Edmund Pyle</span> D.D. was the
eldest Son of the former, and a native of this town.&nbsp; In
piety and inflexible integrity he is supposed to have been much
inferior to his father; and the same was probably the case as to
literary attainments, theological knowledge, critical skill, and
ministerial talents: but he was certainly a man of no mean parts,
as many of his letters that are still extant sufficiently
evince.&nbsp; He was educated at Cambridge.&nbsp; When he went
into orders, or where he officiated immediately after, does not
appear; but in 1732, upon the death of Dr. Littel, and the
appointment of his father to be his successor, he then succeeded
to the vacant place, and became the lecturer, or assistant
preacher and minister of this town; which situation he held till
the year 1751, when he resigned in favour of the late Mr. Vann
Eyre, and became chaplain <a name="page1024"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1024</span>to <i>Bp. Hoadly</i>, and a
Prebendary of Winchester.&nbsp; After the Bp&rsquo;s death, which
happened in 1761, he is supposed to have resided during the
remainder of his life at his prebendal house in that city, and to
have died there in 1776.&nbsp; At Lynn he was deemed proud and
unsociable, which character he, probably, might deserve, for we
have sufficient evidence that even the gentry of this town, for
the most part at least, stood so very low in his estimation as
not to deserve his associating, or holding any communication with
them but what was unavoidable: which to be sure was not
altogether commendable, considering that he stood to those very
people in the relation or character of <i>one of their
pastors</i>.&nbsp; But it is certain that he could at times
divest himself entirely of every appearance of superciliousness
and reservedness, and behave towards those whom he esteemed in a
very free, familiar, engaging and entertaining manner.&nbsp; Of
this his letters still extant are a very good proof, <a
name="citation1024"></a><a href="#footnote1024"
class="citation">[1024]</a> and the same is corroborated <a
name="page1025"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1025</span>by the
testimony of some of his contemporaries who long survived
him.&nbsp; His two brothers, <i>Thomas</i> and <a
name="page1026"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1026</span><i>Philip</i>, who were much younger than he and lived
long after him, though not inferior to him in point of piety and
moral worth, were yet thought to be much <a
name="page1027"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1027</span>so in
point of acumen, or quickness of intellect, and literature.&nbsp;
They had also three sisters, all well spoken of, and that is
supposed to have been all the family their father left.</p>
<p><a name="page1028"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1028</span>12.&nbsp; <i>George Hepburn</i> (<i>or Hepborne</i>)
<i>M.D.</i>&nbsp; He is supposed to have settled here about the
commencement of the last century, as a physician; in which
character he soon acquired high reputation, so as to be placed at
the head of the profession in this part of the kingdom for near
if not quite half a century.&nbsp; He was the favourite physician
of Sir Robert Walpole the then prime minster of this country,
with whom he spent much of his time at his princely seat at
<i>Houghton</i>: and he was also employed in the same capacity by
the principal nobility and gentry of this county.&nbsp; Very
striking and diverting anecdotes are related of him during his
long residence in these parts: but they are hardly proper to be
inserted in the present memoir.&nbsp; He was certainly a very
eminent and distinguished physician.&nbsp; <a
name="page1029"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1029</span>His
posthumous fame is not yet extinguished, as he is still
remembered and mentioned, with the utmost respect whenever the
conversation leads to the recollection of our eminent men of the
last century.&nbsp; His reputation in the latter part of his life
was become so very considerable that he was seldom to be found at
home, being almost always attending one or other of the great
families in the country.&nbsp; The town-practice consequently
devolved upon the two other physicians, <i>Browne</i> and
<i>Lidderdale</i>, both of whom were skilful and judicious
practitioners.&nbsp; But as he lived to a very advanced age, it
so happened that his eye sight gradually failed, and he became
quite blind some years before he died.&nbsp; Having a large
family to maintain, and being perhaps during his extensive
practice not very economical, he would towards the close of life
have been reduced to great difficulties, had it not been for two
pensions which he then very seasonably obtained; one from
<i>George</i> II, through the interest and friendship of Mr.
<i>Pelham</i>, of 100<i>l.</i> a year; and the other from Dr.
<i>Maxwell</i>, a rich relation of his own, of double that sum;
which placed him above want, and rendered his situation tolerably
easy and comfortable.&nbsp; In Walpole&rsquo;s life time, and
during his long premiership, while Hepburn was at the height of
his fame, and in extensive practice, there might be no obvious or
urgent season for befriending him and making provision for him in
a similar way; otherwise it cannot well be supposed that that
minister would have neglected it.&nbsp; But now the case was
altered; the once celebrated and much sought physician was become
old and blind, and no longer capable of following his profession,
and gaining as theretofore <a name="page1030"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1030</span>the means of supporting himself and
family.&nbsp; Something therefore was to be done for him, or he
would sink into penury and want.&nbsp; It has been reported that
though his practice was extensive, yet his fees were but
moderate, considering the length and expence of his journeys,
with the great attendance often required by his patients.&nbsp;
So that his not dying wealthy was less owing to his improvidence
and want of economy or frugality, than to the ungenerous and
niggardly conduct of his patients or employers.&nbsp;
Correspondent with this is said to have been the experience of
others of our physicians since his time, particularly the late
Dr. Hamilton, who never could boast of the great liberality or
munificence of our opulent families, altho&rsquo; he was for some
time our only physician.&nbsp; In short, this writer does not
recollect having ever heard that any physician grew rich here by
his practice, however extensive, unless it was Sir W. Browne, and
it is generally understood and allowed that he really could do
things which most other people could not.&nbsp; Dr. Hepburn died
in 1759, at the very advanced age of ninety.&nbsp; He was a North
Briton, as were also many, if not most of our eminent
physicians.&nbsp; We have not been able to ascertain in what part
of North Britain he drew his first breath, but rather suppose it
to have been in East Lothian, and at, or near Haddington. <a
name="citation1030"></a><a href="#footnote1030"
class="citation">[1030]</a>&nbsp; Nor have we been able to
discover at <a name="page1031"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1031</span>what university he was educated, but think it most
probable it was that of Edinburgh, where so many eminent men of
the same profession have been since educated.&nbsp; Dr. H. was
twice married, first in 1693, to one of his own country-women,
who died in 1707, aged 30.&nbsp; There were several children by
this marriage.&nbsp; He afterwards married again, and his second
wife was a Lynn woman.&nbsp; By her also he had some children,
two of whom at least survived him.&nbsp; But they were remarkably
and vastly inferior, in point of genius and capacity, or
intellectual endowment, to those of the first marriage.&nbsp; His
eldest daughter married a Mr. Young, and was the mother of the
late Miss or Mrs. Dorothy Young, a lady of distinguished
intellectual and literary talents.&nbsp; Another daughter became
the wife of Dr. <i>Lidderdale</i> an eminent physician who
settled here in the early part of George the second&rsquo;s
reign; and died here, in 1766, much regretted, as he is said to
have stood high in the public estimation.&nbsp; The other
daughter by the first wife lived single; but was a very
extraordinary character, and stood unrivalled all her life time
among the wits of this town.&nbsp; Her keen sayings, and stinging
repartees <a name="page1032"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1032</span>are still fresh in the recollection of her surviving
cotemporaries.&nbsp; Between her and her father&rsquo;s daughters
by his last wife there was a most striking and humiliating
contrast: they being but little distant from idiocy.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">William Browne</span> M.D.
afterwards Sir <i>William Browne</i>, <i>Knight</i>, F.R.S. and
<i>President of the Royal College of Physicians</i>.&nbsp; Though
he has been already noticed repeatedly in the course of this
work, yet as he made so conspicuous a figure here in his day, and
our materials relating to him not being yet exhausted, he seems
justly entitled to a place among these biographical
sketches.&nbsp; He was born about the beginning of the year
1692.&nbsp; The place of his birth we have not been able to
discover, but think it to be at some distance from this
town.&nbsp; We have understood that he was introduced here by the
means and under the patronage of the Turner family, to which he
became afterwards implacably hostile.&nbsp; His settlement here
must have taken place at an early period of his life; for his
name was enrolled among our free burgesses in February 1718;
which must have been some time, perhaps two or three years, after
he had first taken up his residence here.&nbsp; Yet he seems to
have previously resided and graduated both at Cambridge and
Oxford, for he denominated himself <i>M.D. of both
Universities</i>.&nbsp; However that was, he appears to have soon
got on fast in the way of his vocation, so as to obtain a large
share of popularity and practice, especially among the middling
and lower orders of the community, which he is said to have
turned to very good account.&nbsp; And he is understood to have
made much more of his <a name="page1033"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1033</span>patients, in the pecuniary way,
than Hepburn was able to make of his among the higher
orders.&nbsp; Having become the popular physician and favourite,
or what we may call the man of the people, he grew quite
regardless of the favour and good opinion of the gentry or higher
classes.&nbsp; As to the gentlemen of the corporation, he held
them very cheap, and treated them at times with the utmost
disdain, looking upon them as his inferiors, and taking
precedence of the very mayor himself, which gave no small
umbrage, as was observed before, at page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page900">900</a></span>.&nbsp; This
took place as early as the year 1723: and this hostility to the
body corporate appears not to have undergone any abatement during
the remainder of his residence here.&mdash;Before we proceed
further we will beg leave here to subjoin the account given of
him in the <i>Encyclopedia Londinensis</i>, the substance of
which is as follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Browne</span> (<i>Sir
William</i>,) an eminent physician, settled originally at Lynn,
where he practised with great success and profit.&nbsp; Having
acquired a competency by his profession, he removed to Queen
Square, Ormond Street, London, where he resided till his death,
which happened March 10, 1774, at the age of eighty two.&nbsp; By
his will he left two prize medals to be annually contended for by
the Cambridge poets.&nbsp; By his lady, who died July 25, 1763,
in her 60th year, he had one daughter, mother to the present Sir
Martin Browne Folkes, bart.&nbsp; Sir William Browne was a very
facetious man, and the active part taken by him in the contest
with the licentiates, in 1768, occasioned his being brought on
the <a name="page1034"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1034</span>stage, in the farce of the Devil upon two
Sticks.&nbsp; Upon Foote&rsquo;s exact representation, of him, in
this farce, with his identical wig and coat, tail figure, and
glass, stiffly applied to his eye, he sent him a card,
complimenting him in having so happily represented him; but, as
he had forgot his <i>muff</i>, he had sent him his own.&nbsp; He
used to frequent the annual ball at the ladies boarding school,
Queen square, merely as a neighbour, a good natured man, and one
fond of the company of sprightly young folkes.&nbsp; A dignitary
of the church being there one day to see his daughter dance, and
finding this upright figure stationed there, told him he believed
he was <i>Hermippus ridivivus</i>, who lived <i>anhelitu
puellarum</i>, &lsquo;by the breath of girls.&rsquo;&nbsp; At the
age of eighty on St. Luke&rsquo;s-day, 1771, he went to
Batson&rsquo;s coffee-house, in a richly laced coat, embroidered
waistcoat and band, and fringed white gloves, to shew himself to
Mr. Crosby then lord Mayor.&nbsp; A gentleman present observing
that he looked very well, he replied, &ldquo;he had neither wife
nor debts.&rdquo;&nbsp; When he lived at Lynn, an extremely
censorious pamphlet was written against him, which he nailed up
against his house door, for the gratification of all who chose to
inspect it.&nbsp; A great number of lively essays, both in prose
and verse, the productions of his pen, were printed and
circulated among his friends, Among those written during his stay
in Lynn were, an Ode in imitation of Horace, ode 3, lib. iii,
addressed to Sir R. Walpole, on his ceasing to be minister.&nbsp;
The Pill Plot; to Dr. Ward, a quack of merry memory, then in the
town; written Nov. 30. 1734.&nbsp; He also translated from the
latin original, Dr. <a name="page1035"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1035</span>Gregory&rsquo;s Elements of
Catoptrics and Dioptrics, to which he added 1. a method for
finding the foci of all Specula, as well as the Lenses
universally, as also magnifying or lessening a given object by a
given speculum, or lens, in any assigned proportion.&nbsp; 2. a
Solution of those Problems which Dr. Gregory has left
undemonstrated.&nbsp; 3. a particular account of Microscopes and
Telescopes, from Mr. Huygens; which was published at Lynn.&nbsp;
His other works are, 1. Opuscula varia utriusque Lingu&aelig;
Medicinam, 4to 1765&mdash;2. a Farewell Oration, 1768,
4to&mdash;3. Fragmentum Isaaci Hawkins Browne completum, 1769,
4to&mdash;4. Appendix ad Opuscula; six odes, 1770, 4to&mdash;5. A
proposal on our Coin, to remedy all present and prevent all
future disorders 1774, 4to&mdash;6. A New years Gift,
1772&mdash;7. Corrections in verse, from the father of the
College, 4to&mdash;8. Speech to the Royal Society, 1772&mdash;9.
An Eulogy and address, 1773&mdash;10. a Latin version of Job,
left unfinished, 4to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the above sketch the reader will perceive that Sir
William Browne was a person of no common cast, or ordinary
genius.&nbsp; Men of his sort are not to be seen every day: and
when they do appear they are sure to attract observation, and are
apt to make a stir wherever they happen to fix their
residence.&nbsp; Sir William was at the head of the party which
opposed the ruling body here for most part of his long residence
in this town: and he appears to have acted his part with no small
skill and dexterity, and with considerable effect.&nbsp; When the
squabble assumed any thing of a literary aspect, <a
name="page1036"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1036</span>Dr. Pyle
seems to have been his chief opponent.&nbsp; At other times he
had the whole corporate body at him, and it must be said that he
generally defended himself and repelled the attacks of the whole
host of those philistines very stoutly and successfully.&nbsp;
There is great reason to believe that the opposition which he and
his friends so long maintained here, was often of real and not
small service to the town.&nbsp; At the contested election in,
1747, he bore a very conspicuous part, as appears from Dr.
Pyle&rsquo;s Letter already quoted.&nbsp; The part he acted on
that occasion is supposed to have laid the foundation of that
intimacy between him and Mr. Folkes which issued in an alliance
between the two families, by the marriage of that gentleman with
Sir William&rsquo;s only daughter and sole heiress.&nbsp; The
issue of that marriage is our present Sir Martin; and Sir
Martin&rsquo;s Lady is the daughter of that same Sir John Turner,
between whom and Sir William Browne there was such inveterate and
sworn enmity.&nbsp; After the Church was rebuilt in 1747, great
complaints were made of the unfair disposal of pews, &amp;c. so
as to exclude in a great measure the common people from the
privilege of sitting within hearing of the minister.&nbsp; Sir
William was one of those who set their faces against this
grievance.&nbsp; How far he and his coadjutors succeeded in
obtaining redress does not appear.&nbsp; But whether they
succeeded or not, the part they then acted was proper and
praise-worthy.&nbsp; Our worthy knight, no doubt, performed many
other deeds that were equally commendable, and others, it seems,
that were not so.&nbsp; Among the leading traits of his character
have been reckoned undaunted assurance <a
name="page1037"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1037</span>and
consummate vanity. <a name="citation1037"></a><a
href="#footnote1037" class="citation">[1037]</a>&nbsp; He died at
his house in Queen Square, whence his grandson, Sir Martin, had
his remains brought down to Hillington, and there buried in the
<a name="page1038"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1038</span>family
vault belonging to that gentleman&rsquo;s ancestors.&nbsp; His
Epitaph, or monumental inscription he had prepared long before he
died, and had an elegant engraving of it set up conspicuously in
one of his own apartments.&nbsp; It was in latin.&nbsp; This
writer has seen a transcript of it long ago, but has not been
able to get a sight of it lately.&nbsp; According to a rough
draught of a translation of if, <a name="page1039"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1039</span>which he has now before him, he
understands that the beginning of it would read as follows, in
English.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sacred to the memory of Sir William Browne,
knight, President of the Royal College of Physicians, London, and
F.R.S. one who much pursued study and business, and by
God&rsquo;s help surmounted the knowledge of Physic; and every
night and day, as his strength would allow, cheerful to give
health to mankind.&nbsp; Even that labour was pleasure to
him.&nbsp; Alas! to be beheld thus doing no more!&nbsp; Yet
asserting that he lived happily, well content, his time
fulfilled; as a guest fill&rsquo;d with life he departed, being a
man who thought nothing belonging to mortals foreign from
him.&nbsp; He died the &mdash; day of &mdash; in the year &mdash;
aged &mdash;.&nbsp; He was born on the birth day of Cicero, the
3rd of January 1692&mdash;Country!&nbsp; O be perpetual! and

Newton, Boyle, Locke; far from mad-men, and from some sort of
wisemen &mdash; &mdash; &mdash;&rdquo; <a

1040</span>14.&nbsp; <i>Thomas Lidderdale</i> M.D.&nbsp; He is
said to have been an elegant and an accomplished scholar, as well
as an excellent physician.&nbsp; The land of his nativity, as
well as that of Dr. Hepburn, was North Britain; and it appears
that he was related to some of the first families in that
country: and such was the respectability of his character after
he removed to England, that he attracted the notice and obtained
the friendship of some of the first personages in this
kingdom.&nbsp; He was born in 1709, and settled as a physician in
this town about the year 1731, where he continued ever after to
the day of his death, which happened in 1766.&nbsp; As to his
descent, we learn that he was the &ldquo;second son of David
Lidderdale of St. Mary&rsquo;s Isle, by Eleonora the eldest
daughter of Sir James Dunbar of Mochrum, bart. by Isabella, 2nd.
daughter and coheiress of Sir Thomas Nicholson of Carnock, bart.
and Lady Margaret, eldest daughter of Alexander 2nd earl of
Linlithgow and Lady Mary Dowglass, daughter of William, tenth
earl of <i>Angus</i> or Dowglass.&rdquo;&nbsp; This we have
learnt from his <i>Pedigree</i>, which is now in the possession
of a very respectable gentleman of this town, and which leads us
back, by a long line of ancestry, through the Dunbars of Mochrum
and Carnock, earls of Dunbar, of Murray, of March, heroes of the
Holy War, earls and princes of Northumberland, kings of Scotland,
&amp;c. up even to the Saxon kings of England.&nbsp; So that in
this view it could be no disparagement to any family in England,
or out of it, to cultivate the acquaintance or friendship of Dr.
Lidderdale.&nbsp; But it is certain that he derived far more real
honour and dignity from his own personal worthiness, <a
name="page1041"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1041</span>or
respectability of character, than he could possibly do from his
whole long catalogue of illustrious ancestors: and that, no
doubt, was what raised him so high in the estimation of his
numerous acquaintance in this country.&nbsp; Like other younger
sons of respectable families, he appears not to have had much of
this world&rsquo;s goods bestowed on him by his father, beyond
what was spent upon his education, which seems to have been
excellent, from the high reputation he sustained as a
scholar.&nbsp; The rudiments of learning he is supposed to have
received at one of the grammar-schools of his native country; at
one of whose universities he probably spent sometime afterwards;
but he finished his education, if we are not mistaken, at the
university of Rheims in France, where he received the degree of
M.D. which was also conferred upon him afterwards by the
university of St. Andrews.&nbsp; It is not very likely that he
had begun to practise before he came to England; for he arrived
in this town, and took up his residence here, as a physician, at
the early age of <i>twenty two</i>.&nbsp; His introduction here
he probably owed to his countryman, Dr. Hepburn, who was then
advancing in years, and on the verge of his grand climacteric,
though he lived near thirty years after.&nbsp; Our young
physician soon attracted the notice and esteem of the enlightened
and literary part of the public; and being patronized by Hepburn,
he presently came into good practice; but like that of his
patron, it seems to have been chiefly among those of the higher
class.&nbsp; It appears, from one of his letters, that he was
employed by <a name="page1042"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1042</span>the Townshend family from the very commencement of his
practice; and of that family he is known to have retained the
esteem and friendship to the very last.&nbsp; The Walpoles,
Cokes, and Bedingfelds, the Hares, the Hostes, and most of the
great families in these parts were numbered among his
friends.&nbsp; With such high connections, it might be expected
that he could not fail of being placed in easy, if not in
affluent circumstances.&nbsp; It did not however so turn
out.&nbsp; A sine cure office or place in the custom-house was
all he obtained from the favour and affection, the interest and
admiration of those honourable and noble personages, besides the
fees of attendance in the way of his profession, which appear
scarce ever to have corresponded with the length of his journeys,
and the time he was often required to spend in attending upon his
patients.&nbsp; But many beside him have found the smiles of the
great very unproductive of solid advantages.&mdash;About seven
years after he had fixed his residence here, he married Miss
Susan Hepburn, the third daughter, if we are not mistaken, of his
great friend and patron, Dr. Hepburn.&nbsp; He was then 29 years
old, and the lady some few years older.&nbsp; They lived together
about 28 years, when he left her a widow with one daughter, said
to have been an extremely amiable and accomplished lady, whom the
mother long survived; one dying in 1787, and the other in 1796,
at the very advanced age of 92.&mdash;How much the doctor felt
the unproductiveness of his practice, and the scantiness of his
income, some years before he died, and how anxiously he wished to
better his condition and be placed in easy circumstances, will
appear from the two <a name="page1043"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1043</span>following Letters, one written to
the right honourable Chas. Townshend, then secretary at war, and
the other to general Townshend, afterwards Marquis
Townshend.&nbsp; The first was dated at Lynn Oct. 10, 1762, and
worded as follows,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sir,</p>
<p>Having been now upwards of thirty years a Norfolk Physician;
where my practice has been attended with greater reputation than
self-interest or money; it is no small mortification at last to
find myself totally neglected and forgotten, among the many
promotions and medical preferments which have been made for
sometime, and are still daily making&mdash;Greenwich Hospital, or
some Almshouse, I had reason to believe was intended for me, but
that is gone with other things&mdash;I now, Dear Sir, beg leave
to throw myself at your feet to dispose of me as you think
properest and best, whether in a Physical or Civil capacity, I
entirely submit to your determination and pleasure.&nbsp; Indeed
I am almost worn out in the service of this county, and am no
longer able to undergo the fatigue of winter journeys and
slavery; neither is the practice of physic, or manner of
residence in the country the same as when I had the honor of
prescribing for your truly noble grand-father and his family at
Rainham.&mdash;Your generous humanity, and known friendly
disposition towards me, will I hope plead my excuse for the
freedom of this Letter, and remind you of one who has long been,
with the most cordial affection and fidelity, Dear Sir, Your most
obedient and devoted humble Servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">T. L.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other Letter was dated April 19th, 1763, and expressed
thus,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dear General,</p>
<p>It gave me real concern that my health would not allow me to
pay my personal respects at Cranmer, during your short stay in
Norfolk&mdash;Indeed I have now too much reason <a
name="page1044"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1044</span>to fear
that my constitution and age will not permit me long to undergo
the fatigue and slavery of business in the country, where I have
hitherto practised with more reputation than profit; I therefore
hope you&rsquo;ll pardon my present solicitation for some
appointment (through your interest and favour) that may render
life less laborious to myself, and not useless to my
family.&nbsp; Having upwards of thirty years disclaimed any
application or pretensions but those of my connection, and long
endeavoured to be serviceable in this county, I rely upon your
friendship and favour to dispose of me as you shall think
properest and best, without any particular attachment to the
Profession of Physick, where so many, of a younger date and less
service, have been put over my head.</p>
<p>I am, with the utmost regard,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Dear Sir, &amp;c.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">T. L.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The former Letter was not the first the Dr. addressed to that
correspondent on the same occasion.&nbsp; We have seen the copy
of another, of a prior date, which he wrote to him to the same
effect.&nbsp; But these applications or solicitations did not
succeed.&nbsp; The Townshends did nothing for him or his family
in his lifetime, whatever they did afterwards, though nothing
could exceed their professions of respect and esteem for
him.&nbsp; The place he got here in the customs was not obtained
by their interest, but by that of Lord Orford and Sir John
Turner: and he continued in vain to wish and hope for further
preferment to his dying day.&nbsp; But however unproductive his
practice had been, and much as he had felt on that account, his
death was said to be generally and deeply regretted; as appears
from the following paragraph in the public papers of that time,
drawn up, it seems, by a celebrated character, who was one of his
warm admirers&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page1045"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1045</span>&ldquo;Lynn Regis Norfolk, April 18. 1766.&nbsp; On
Friday the 11th. instant died here extremely lamented by the
whole county, Doctor Thomas Lidderdale, a physician no less
eminent for his skill and happy penetration, than for his wit,
learning, and probity.&nbsp; His sudden sallies in conversation
were so equally fortunate with his premeditation in prescribing,
that his power over dulness, and disease, may be said to have
been alike irresistable.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several Epitaphs, or monumental inscriptions, were also
composed for him about the same time, some in latin and some in
english, of which the following is one of the most
remarkable.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Sacred to the
Memory<br />
Of Thomas Lidderdale, a most eminent Physician,<br />
in investigating the causes of diseases acutely sagacious,<br />
in his practice as remarkably successful.<br />
They to whom he restored health deservedly regret their loss,<br
/>
The sick will wish, but wish in vain, for a physician<br />
of equal abilities.<br />
He possessed a vein of polite wit, and inoffensive humour,<br />
ever flowing, ever new.<br />
His sentiments, conversation, and actions were all<br />
highly becoming a man of probity and a gentleman.<br />
His Friendship, his Advice, his best services<br />
were wanting to none.<br />
With such sentiments, heightened by such an<br />
amiably moral character, it is little to be wondered<br />
that his life should be dear, and his death afflicting<br />
to all.<br />
If polite literature is held in deserved estimation by men,<br />
If piety, and the duties of humanity are regarded by God,<br />
To his memory will be paid lasting honours<br />
on Earth,<br />
To himself will be given eternal rewards<br />
in Heaven.<br />
He died the 11th. of April 1766 &AElig;t. 57.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Lidderdale could, as we have seen, boast not only of the
professed esteem and friendship of the great, but, as was before
hinted, could claim kindred with some of them, particularly the
<i>Stair</i> family, to which he is said to have been very nearly
related.&nbsp; The following paragraph on the death of the great
Lord Stair, being found among his papers, in his handwriting, was
probably drawn up by him&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Saturday May the 19th. 1747.&nbsp; This
night <a name="page1046"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1046</span>died in the 78th year of his age, at his lodging in
the Cannongate, the right honourable Field marshal Joan earl of
Stair, one of the sixteen peers for Scotland, knight of the most
ancient order of the Thistle, governor of Minorca, General of
Marines, Colonel of the royal regiment of Scots Grey Dragoons,
and one of his majesty&rsquo;s most honourable Privy
Council&mdash;A nobleman of the most rare abilities, being
endowed with every virtue that could either accomplish the
Statesman, or adorn the Warrior.&mdash;The Court of Versailles
and States general will tell of his wisdom, and prudence, while
the plains of Ramillies, Oudenard, Malplaquet, and Dettingen will
continue lasting monuments of his bravery and conduct.&nbsp;
Where shall we begin his Encomium?&nbsp; How equally qualified
either for Camp or Court; how great without pride; now amiable
without vanity; how just without rigour; how wise without
arrogance, and bountiful without ostentation: supporting the
highest dignities with decency, humanity, and moderation, only to
be found among the truly great; being possessed of every talent
which can render man great in himself, and beneficial to his
friends and country.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is reported that Dr. Lidderdale had a genius for poetry,
and would sometimes amuse himself in writing verses, and
particularly epigrams, one of which is said to be the
following&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;God and the Doctor men alike adore,<br />
Just on the Brink of Danger&mdash;not before:<br />
The Danger past, both are alike requited;<br />
God is forgotten and the Doctor slighted.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following Copy of verses by the revd. Joseph Sympson, to
the memory of Miss Lidderdale, whose excellent character has been
already noticed, will not it is hoped be deemed an improper
conclusion to this article.</p>
<blockquote><p>In vain Maria, we the healing Art<br />
Implor&rsquo;d his balmy succours to impart:<br />
The healing Art, despairing of his power<br />
That well he knew diminish&rsquo;d every hour,<br />
With mournful visage from thy couch withdrew,<br />
While hence to bliss thy gentle Spirit flew.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sure, meek Saint, the just decree of
Heav&rsquo;n<br />
To thee no Indian Paradise has giv&rsquo;n;<br />
No verdant hill surrounded by the floods;<br />
No flow&rsquo;ry valley in the depth of woods;<br />
Thou sought&rsquo;st thy native place, the seats divine;<br />
The native place of ev&rsquo;ry soul like thine!<br />
Had Angels on thy bosom fix&rsquo;d their eyes<br />
They ne&rsquo;er had seen a faulty thought arise:<br />
All there was guiltless as a Hermit&rsquo;s dream,<br />
<a name="page1047"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1047</span>All
mild as is the Sun&rsquo;s departing beam:<br />
No wayward passions with malignant strife<br />
Disturb&rsquo;d the peaceful current of thy life:<br />
The soft affections, loving and belov&rsquo;d<br />
Alone its surface tremulously mov&rsquo;d.<br />
To live as Virtue bids is fame most high;<br />
The second praise is virtuously to die;<br />
And both to thee are due&mdash;as on the bed<br />
Of tedious pain thou long reclin&rsquo;d thy head,<br />
Calm resignation ever smoothed thy face,<br />
And unto sickness lent a languid grace;<br />
While Hope and Faith, fair sister Seraphs near,<br />
Still whisp&rsquo;ring holy comfort in thine ear,<br />
With radiant finger pointed out the way<br />
That leads the good to everlasting day.<br />
Tho&rsquo; thou among the bright ethereal choir<br />
Again behold&rsquo;st thy much regretted Sire,<br />
No perfect bliss thy tender heart can know,<br />
Reflecting pensive on thy Mother&rsquo;s woe;<br />
For ah! thy piercing glance still sees her mourn<br />
In pious melancholy o&rsquo;er thy urn,<br />
Yet let not this invade thy breast with care;<br />
For Hope and Faith, the same seraphic pair<br />
That brought to all thy sufferings sweet relief,<br />
Have stay&rsquo;d below to mitigate her grief:<br />
Ev&rsquo;n now they kindly check the rising sigh<br />
And close the opening sluices of her eye,<br />
Nor will they quit her till from sorrow free,<br />
She joins in Heav&rsquo;n thy sainted Sire and thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We may here further observe, that among the friends and
correspondents of Dr. Lidderdale are found the names of <i>Dr.
Heberden</i>, <i>Dr. R. Taylor</i>, and <i>Sir John
Pringle</i>.&nbsp; Between him and the latter however there was a
kind of relationship, by the marriage of a sister of his to Sir
John&rsquo;s brother, the issue of which marriage was the late
<i>admiral Pringle</i>.&nbsp; Sir John used to correspond with
the family long after the death of Dr. Lidderdale, and so we
presume did also the admiral, <a name="page1048"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1048</span>as miss Lidderdale and he were so
nearly related.&nbsp; But we are not sure that that lady and her
mother received many favours or much assistance from that
quarter.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Some additional papers relating to Dr. Hepburn&rsquo;s royal
pension having fallen into the author&rsquo;s hands since that
article was printed off, he begs leave to take some notice of
them here, by way of postscript or supplement to that same
article.&mdash;It was there observed that the doctor had obtained
a royal pension by the interest and friendship of Mr.
Pelham.&nbsp; After the death of that minister a fresh
application for the continuance of the pension became necessary,
and this application was made to the succeeding minister, the
Duke of Newcastle, and through him to the sovereign.&nbsp; The
following is a copy of the Letter from the doctor on that
occasion, dated May 14. 1754.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My Lord,</p>
<p>The grateful remembrance of my happy success in applying to
Mr. Pelham 4 years ago for his Majesty&rsquo;s Bounty, soon
determined me to address your Grace for its continuance, in whose
congenial generous breast I was sure to find the same benevolent
disposition.&nbsp; But lest the prolixity of the
<i>Narrative</i>, by which it was proper to inform your Grace of
the present state of your petitioner, should possibly put a stop
to the timely inspection of the whole, I have thrown that apart,
to be considered whenever your Grace shall think proper.&nbsp;
Meantime confiding entirely in your Grace&rsquo;s favour, I beg
the honour of being admitted, My Lord,</p>
<p>Your Grace&rsquo;s most obedient and truly faithful humble
Servant</p>
<p style="text-align: right">G. H.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>Narrative</i>, above alluded to, was as
follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My sight has been declining for seven or
eight years past.&nbsp; But in the year 1750 (the 80th. of my
age) I became almost quite blind, as I have now for two years
past been altogether so.&nbsp; Having lost most of my business
with my sight, and as the distribution of my small fortune among
<i>six</i> daughters whilst I could see had left me but a poor
pittance to subsist on, I implored Mr. Pelham&rsquo;s assistance
for his majesty&rsquo;s Bounty, which he was pleased with great
alacrity to undertake: and with what zeal and address he
performed it does not obscurely appear from what he was pleased
to tell me at Holkham (where I had the honour to thank him Viva
Voce) viz.&nbsp; That he never knew his majesty grant a favour <a
name="page1049"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1049</span>with more
cheerfullness than he did this.&mdash;The Earl of Leicester has
annually done me the honour to receive this royal Bounty from Mr.
Pelham&rsquo;s own hand; two noble securities for one hundred
pounds.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the above Letter an answer, of which the following is a
copy, was received from <i>James West Esq.</i> first Secretary of
the Treasury, dated May 16. 1754.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sir, I am directed by the Duke of Newcastle
to acquaint you that his Grace has received your Letter, and that
you may be assured his grace will be the means of the same royal
bounty being continued to you as was in Mr. Pelham&rsquo;s
time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I am, Sir, Your most humble
Servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">J. West.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this Letter an answer was returned in the following words
(dated May 19. 1754)&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sir, The honour his Grace the Duke of
Newcastle has done me, by your Letter of the 16th. instant, is
extremely obliging.&nbsp; But his Grace&rsquo;s readiness to
oblige has enhanced these obligations beyond expression.&nbsp; I
must therefore humbly beg my noble friend&rsquo;s assistance how
to acknowledge them as I would, as well as to receive, the royal
favour so frankly promised.&nbsp; Meantime I beg his Grace to
believe that my breast is full of all the gratitude that is
possible to be expressed.</p>
<p>I am with very great esteem, Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Your obedient humble Servant</p>
<p style="text-align: right">G. H.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may be here just added, that though Lidderdale could not
boast of the generosity or munificence of the Townshends, the
case was somewhat otherwise with Hepburn, as appears from the
following copy of a Letter dated July 11th. 1756, from him to the
then Lord Townshend.&nbsp; The copy, probably in the handwriting
of one of his daughters by the <i>last marriage</i>, is as
follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My Lord, The singular testimony of your
Lordships regard (which I lately had the honour to receive from
Mr. Case) has, like the Sunbeams <a name="page1050"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1050</span>of Summer to a decayed plant,
giveing (given) warmth and springly vigour to the winter of my
age.&nbsp; A warmth, my Lord, which has filled my breast with
greattitude (gratitude) that will last as long as blood
circulates in the veanns (veins) or the heart continues to beat
in the breast of,</p>
<p>My Lord, Your Lordship&rsquo;s ever obliged, most
obedient,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">And most thankful humble
servant.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">G. H.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the kindness of Dr. <i>Maxwell</i>, in settling upon his
uncle Hepburn the very handsome annuity of 200<i>l.</i> a year,
was noticed above, it should have been also observed that the
nephew had very great obligations to the uncle, and owed perhaps
almost every thing to him in regard to his good fortune or
advancement in the world.&nbsp; The following Letter from Hepburn
to the Duke of Devonshire, then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, where
Maxwell was in the meantime stationed as a surgeon in the army,
may serve to throw some light upon that subject.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My Lord, The honour I have had for many
years of being known to, and sometimes taken notice of by your
grace at Houghton in Norfolk, has fixed in me such a firm opinion
of your grace&rsquo;s humane disposition, that it is without the
least diffidence I now presume to write to your Grace, in behalf
of Mr. Maxwell, a surgeon, the bearer.&nbsp; His near relation to
me, My Lord, claims indeed my endeavours to serve him; but much
more his own merit.&nbsp; However as consanguinity too often
occasions partiality, I choose, my Lord, and think it much more
equitable to leave him to produce vouchers for his character from
among the military officers of the best rank in Ireland, where he
has served near twenty years&mdash;Let this have the honour to
introduce him to your Grace, as my nephew.&nbsp; Let the merit of
whatever boon he may beg of your Grace (if any) depend upon the
voice of those Gens D&rsquo;honneur who have been so long
constant witnesses of his behaviour and practice.&mdash;And now,
my Lord, as in full assurance of your Grace&rsquo;s good nature I
have ventured upon this Letter, so &rsquo;tis in your
Grace&rsquo;s Goodness, I only can hope for pardon, and beg leave
to subscribe myself, Lynn Jan. 12. 1739&ndash;40.&nbsp; My Lord,
Your Grace&rsquo;s &amp;c.&nbsp; G. H.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>15.&nbsp; <i>John Rastrick</i> M.A.&nbsp; In the order of
time, or seniority, his name in this list ought to have preceded
several of the former ones, as he was many years older than even
Pyle and Hepburn; and in point of learning and piety, or real
respectability of character, he was probably not inferior to any
one that has been yet named <a name="page1051"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1051</span>of the former inhabitants of this
town.&nbsp; He was born in 1649, at Heckington near Sleaford, in
Lincolnshire.&nbsp; Of the situation, or circumstances of his
parents we are uninformed.&nbsp; They probably ranked among the
reputable yeomanry of that place.&nbsp; Their son, being designed
for the ministry, may be supposed to be placed at a proper age at
one of those seminaries in the country where youth are prepared
for the university.&nbsp; Having acquired the rudiments of
classical learning, he was sent to Trinity College in Cambridge,
where he finished his academical education and obtained the
degree of M.A.&nbsp; He then went into orders; but when that was,
we have not learnt.&nbsp; He probably officiated afterwards as
curate for sometime; but that could not be long, for he became
vicar of Kirkton, near Boston, in 1674, when he was about 25
years of age.&nbsp; No sooner had he settled at Kirkton than he
felt the arduousness of the charge he had undertaken.&nbsp; His
congregation was large, and the parish of great extent.&nbsp; How
much his mind was improved with these considerations, and how
anxious he was lest he should fail in the due execution of his
office, will appear from his own testimony on the subject, in a
Letter to a friend:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The number and distance of the inhabitants,
(says he) gave me a very sensible concern, and I was very uneasy
under the burden that lay upon me: I knew not what to do for so
many souls, that were also most of them so remote from my
dwelling, nor how to discharge my duty in a place, that (as a
learned, pious, and worthy clergyman, my friend told me) was as
large as some of the dioceses of the primitive church.&nbsp;
Catechising, and preaching to such as <a
name="page1052"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1052</span>would
come under them, was not all I had to do.&nbsp; But I could not
forbear being concerned with such as would bring their children
to baptism, or offer themselves to the Lord&rsquo;s Table, how to
carry it, and answer the Church&rsquo;s expectations, with
satisfaction to my mind, and fidelity to my highest trust.&nbsp;
In catechising and preaching, I could suit myself, my doctrine,
and discourse to the condition of the people; but (by the rules
and orders of my publick station) in administering sacraments and
applying the seals, (especially baptism) I saw I must treat them
all alike.&nbsp; Yet if catechising and preaching be to prepare
men for sacraments for themselves or theirs, it undeniably
supposeth, that the <i>latter</i> are not to be given to such in
whom the <i>former</i> hath no effect, nor to their
children.&nbsp; Qualifications for privileges I knew were
necessary, but where <i>those</i> were wanting, it was impossible
I should apply <i>these</i> without a relucting mind: and
therefore whatever I might have been in the capacity of a
lecturer, or bare preacher, yet as a <i>pastor</i> it could not
be, that I should be unconcerned in acts of discipline and
government, and in judging of my own ministerial performances of
that kind.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such is his own account; and there is no reason to doubt of
its correctness.&mdash;Having carefully formed an idea of his
line of duty, he set himself in good earnest upon acting up to
it; but here he met with insuperable difficulties, which troubled
and plagued him exceedingly, and forced him at last, to resign
his living <a name="citation1052"></a><a href="#footnote1052"
class="citation">[1052]</a> and quit the church of which he had
been many <a name="page1053"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1053</span>years a minister, and which he would probably have
continued still to be, had he been permitted by his
ecclesiastical superiors to act with honesty and a good <a
name="page1054"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1054</span>conscience, which they however were no way disposed to
allow him to do.&nbsp; Thus was he forced to resign his vicarage
of Kirkton; after he had held it 14 years, while numbers of
sporting, fox hunting, and loose living incumbents were suffered
to retain their situations with impunity and without the least
check or remonstrance.&nbsp; But though he quitted the ministry,
he did not immediately withdraw from the communion of the
established church, for we find him communicating sometime after
at Frampton, where his friend <i>Ishmael Burroughs</i> was
curate, who himself afterwards left the church and became pastor
of a Presbyterian congregation at Wisbeach, where he continued
the remainder <a name="page1055"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1055</span>his days.&nbsp; We are not sure that either he or
Rastrick engaged in the ministry among the Dissenters, or even
actually joined them, till after the Revolution, when the
Toleration Act made it perfectly safe for them so to do.&nbsp; It
does not appear at what time Burroughs undertook his charge, or
entered upon his ministry at Wisbeach; but it appears that
Rastrick entered upon his ministry and took the charge of the
Presbyterian congregation at Lynn in 1701, <a
name="citation1055"></a><a href="#footnote1055"
class="citation">[1055]</a> for we find that he was minister here
26 years; and he died in 1727.&nbsp; The commencement of his
ministry here was therefore 14 years after he had resigned or
quitted Kirkton, and perhaps 30 years or more after the
commencement of his public ministry: so that at the time of his
death he had been in the ministry between 50 and 60 years.&nbsp;
How and where he spent his time during the interval between his
quitting Kirkton and his settling at Lynn, we have not been able
to discover.&nbsp; Wherever it was, he spent it no doubt, in a
manner worthy of himself, or of that integrity and goodness of
character which he so uniformly and so well sustained through
life.&nbsp; Old members of that congregation used to say, 30
years ago, that he settled here as successor to a Mr.
<i>Williams</i>, who, as far as we can find, was the only
minister of that society during the 25 years, that intervened
between the death of Mr. Horne and the arrival of Mr.
Rastrick.&nbsp; Of this Mr. Williams we have not been able to
obtain any further information.&nbsp; Where he came <a
name="page1056"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1056</span>from,
what was his character, how long he was settled here, what became
of him, whether he died here or removed elsewhere, must of course
be all left among the uncertainties.&nbsp; When Mr. Rastrick came
to settle at Lynn, he had been 14 years in a state of separation
from the Church, and therefore a kind of dissenter.&nbsp; The
Presbyterian was the denomination he appeared most to approve,
and it was that which he afterwards joined: but he had too much
moderation, and too little of a sectarian spirit to be admired by
any existing party.&nbsp; Dissatisfied with many things in the
Church, he was far from approving of all things he saw among the
dissenters.&nbsp; This made him often think and say (as he tells
us) that, as things then stood in England, &ldquo;he was neither
fit for Church nor Meeting.&rdquo;&nbsp; That this unprejudiced
or unbiassed disposition of his should not insure to him the
admiration or esteem of his new friends or connection, but would
tend to lower rather than exalt him in their estimation, and so
prove prejudicial to his interest among them, must not be deemed
very strange or wonderful; especially as he was pretty free in
expressing his disapprobation of what he thought amiss.&nbsp;
That such was the case appears from his own testimony: &ldquo;My
conscience beareth me witness, (says he) That in my more private
station in all the places where I have served, I have not been
sparing both in preaching and practice, to express myself, and
set myself against the corruptions and errors of Dissenters,
tho&rsquo; it has been so much to my hindrance and disadvantage
in outward or worldly respects.&rdquo;&nbsp; In another place he
says, &ldquo;In the mean time, I hope (in the <a
name="page1057"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1057</span>strength
of Christ) to abide in the true catholic and apostolic christian
faith and church, and in the true protestant reform&rsquo;d
religion: and (as to the church of England so called) a <i>mere
nonconformist</i>, not addicting myself to any faction, sect, or
party of christians, as such, under what denomination
soever.&rdquo;&nbsp; All this is very honourable to his memory:
and it may help in some measure to account for a person of his
learning and talents remaining all the residue of his days the
minister of a comparatively obscure and poor congregation, (as
this at Lynn, at best, certainly was,) while many respectable and
opulent congregations were in want of such pastors, or were
supplied by men of far inferior abilities and attainments.&nbsp;
The same may also help to account for those difficulties and
trials he afterwards experienced from his congregation, or from
certain individuals that composed a part of it.&nbsp; Such
troublers or disturbers a moderate, liberal-minded minister is
pretty sure of finding in most dissenting congregations.&nbsp; A
thorough-paced bigot, or sectary, has a far better chance of
escaping them, or at least of obtaining their countenance and
co-operation.&nbsp; Rastrick kept his mind open to conviction; as
appears from the change which took place in his sentiments in the
latter part of his life, when he embraced the opinions which
distinguished Clarke and Jackson among the churchmen, and Peirce
and Hallet and others among the Dissenters.&nbsp; It is somewhat
remarkable that both Pyle and he were then proselyted to those
opinions; so that the Church and the meeting here became equally
heterodox.&nbsp; This change in his sentiments appears to have <a
name="page1058"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1058</span>extended
further than what related to the athanasian trinity, and to have
soon divided the congregation into two parties, one approving and
the other disapproving of his ministry. <a
name="citation1058"></a><a href="#footnote1058"
class="citation">[1058]</a>&nbsp; It is probable that much, if
not most of his discomfort here sprung from this source.&nbsp;
This difference of opinion, however did not, in his time, produce
separation; for they all continued, as far as we can learn, to
attend on his ministry, while he lived, notwithstanding their
diversity of sentiments.&nbsp; The malcontents not only were
Athanasians, but appear to have been also strongly tinctured with
Calvinism, and even with Antinomianism; which indeed has been
thought to be little, or rather nothing more than
&ldquo;Calvinism run to seed.&rdquo;&nbsp; To them it is no great
wonder that Mr. R&rsquo;s ministry proved unacceptable, or that
they should cause him some disquietude and unhappiness.&nbsp;
That such was really the case, may be inferred from his very
Epitaph; and it is further corroborated by oral tradition, as
well as by the contents the prefer to a MS. volume of his, left
by him ready for the press; though, for some reason, to us
unknown, it never was published; and it has been now many years
in the possession of the present writer.&nbsp; This volume was
certainly far more worthy of publication than thousands that have
been published since, and that are still daily publishing.&nbsp;
It is entitled, &ldquo;Plain and Easy Principles of <a
name="page1059"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1059</span>Christian
Religion and Obedience; or, The Necessity of keeping
Christ&rsquo;s Commandments, in order to our preserving an
Interest in his Favour, Demonstrated from John 15. 10.&nbsp; By
John Rastrick M.A. sometime vicar of Kirkton near Boston in
Lincolnshire, and now minister of the gospel at King&rsquo;s Lyn
in Norfolk.&rdquo; <a name="citation1059"></a><a
href="#footnote1059" class="citation">[1059]</a>&nbsp; It <a
name="page1060"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1060</span>is a
sensible and notable performance, and contains many striking and
curious thoughts, <a name="citation1060"></a><a
href="#footnote1060" class="citation">[1060]</a> especially in
the <i>appendix</i>, where the trinitarian controversy, and that
relating to the person of Christ are more particularly adverted
to and discussed.&nbsp; We are assured that he intended <a
name="page1061"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1061</span>to
publish this work himself; but being by some means prevented, he
left instructions at his death for his son to do it afterwards:
which yet he did not do, despairing <i>perhaps</i> of its
convincing, or having any good effect on the malcontents, and
fearing it might irritate them further, and so preclude the
possibility of re-union, or a restoration of harmony in the
congregation.&nbsp; But whatever consideration it was that
prevented the publication of this volume, it is certain that
harmony was never restored, or a re-union effected between these
two parties: the discontented or antinomian party went off
afterwards, in the son&rsquo;s time, and formed a kind of
Independent Society, which after assuming various shapes, and
undergoing divers changes, produced the Baptist congregation
here, which now meets at the new chapel in Broad Street.&nbsp;
Mr. Rastrick died in 1727, at the advanced age of 78. <a
name="citation1061"></a><a href="#footnote1061"
class="citation">[1061]</a>&nbsp; He lived, as did also his son
afterwards, in that house in Spinner Lane, now occupied by Mr.
<i>Dennis</i>, behind which stood the chapel, both of which, if
we are not mistaken, were his own property.&nbsp; He left behind
him several things in MS. some of which, beside the volume above
noticed, are now in the possession of the present writer.&nbsp;
The whole is written <a name="page1062"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1062</span>in a very small hand, and with
singular neatness, for he, as well as his son, was an admirable
penman.&nbsp; He was doubtless an eminent scholar, and reckoned a
very good mathematician, which is not unlikely, as he was
cotemporary and of the same college with <i>Barrow</i>: nor is it
very probable that that generation of Dissenters had among them
many if any names of superior learning and respectability.</p>
<p><a name="page1063"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1063</span>Of
his writings not much went through the press, which we may
presume had not been the case had he lived in later times, or
under more auspicious circumstances.&nbsp; Of his printed works
the present writer has not heard of any except the following: 1.
&ldquo;An Account of the Nonconformity of <i>John Rastrick</i>,
A.M. sometime vicar of <i>Kirkton</i>, near <i>Boston</i>, in
Lincolnshire; containing the occasion and circumstances of his
secession from that place.&nbsp; In a Letter to a
Friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; [It was printed in London, in 1705; and the
friend to whom it was addressed was Dr. <i>Edmund
Calamy</i>.]&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. &ldquo;A Sermon at the ordination of
Mr <i>Samuel Savage</i>, at St. Edmund&rsquo;s Bury, April 22.
1714.&nbsp; With an exhortation to him at the
close.&rdquo;&mdash;3. &ldquo;Two letters to Mr. <i>Ralph
Thoresby</i> of <i>Leeds</i>, giving an account of a great number
of <i>Roman</i> coins found at <i>Flete</i> in Lincolnshire, and
other antiquities found at <i>Spalding</i>, &amp;c. and printed
in the <i>Phil. Trans.</i> No. 279, p. 1156,
&amp;c.&mdash;4.&nbsp; &ldquo;A <i>supplement</i> to the latter,
printed in the same work, No. 377, p. 340.&rdquo;&mdash;His
unprinted, or unpublished works appear to have been much more
numerous and considerable; but they got into different hands
after the son&rsquo;s death, and most of them perhaps have been
since lost.&nbsp; Some of them were in the possession of the
son&rsquo;s successors Messrs. <i>Mayhew</i> and <i>Warner</i>,
and some in that of the late Dr. <i>Lloyd</i>.&nbsp; What became
of them we know not.&nbsp; The two following articles with some
other loose papers came into the possession of the present
writer&mdash;1. The MS. volume before mentioned, entitled
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Plain and Easy Principles of Christian
Religion and Obedience</span>; or the necessity of keeping
Christ&rsquo;s Commandments, in order to our preserving an
interest in his favour, demonstrated.&rdquo;&nbsp; [It would make
a duodecimo volume of 250 or 300 pages, and may be called an
ingenious and elaborate piece, written out with great care and
singular neatness.] <a name="citation1063"></a><a
href="#footnote1063" class="citation">[1063]</a>&nbsp; 2.
&ldquo;A <span class="smcap">Short Catechism</span>; containing
<a name="page1064"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1064</span>the
chief heads of the christian religion, and faith of
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is carefully and neatly written like the
other MS. volume, yet it does not appear to have been intended
for the press, but rather as a present, or new-year&rsquo;s gift
to his children, the name of one of whom, <i>Hannah Rastrick</i>,
is prefixed to it in her father&rsquo;s hand writing.&mdash;The
smaller MSS. are some of them in prose and some in <i>verse</i>,
for Mr. R. <i>like one of our present mathematicians</i>, <a
name="citation1064a"></a><a href="#footnote1064a"
class="citation">[1064a]</a> would sometimes leave those profound
or severer studies, and amuse himself with writing little poems;
but with this difference, that these productions of the former
were only meant for the amusement or gratification of his own
children and family, or the small circle of intimate and
particular friends, and not for the inspection and admiration of
the public at large, like those of the latter. <a
name="citation1064b"></a><a href="#footnote1064b"
class="citation">[1064b]</a>&nbsp; Without attempting to draw any
further parallel or comparison between our present or former race
of mathematicians, we shall here close our memoir of the
venerable John Rastrick.</p>
<p><a name="page1065"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1065</span>16.&nbsp; <i>William Rastrick</i>.&nbsp; He was the
only son, or at least the only surviving son of the former: and
he was every way a son worthy of such a father.&nbsp; In point of
<a name="page1066"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1066</span>genius
and learning, virtue and piety, or real respectability or
exemplariness of character, he has always been understood as
nothing inferior to him, or to any one of his contemporaries
either in this town or in all this part of the kingdom.&nbsp; The
very servants, and all those who were most intimate in the
family, and who had therefore the best opportunity of knowing and
judging of his private <a name="page1067"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1067</span>and real character, always deemed
and spoke of him as one of the best of men and most exemplary of
christians.&nbsp; Knowing how much his father had been teazed and
tried by one part of the congregation, he never would undertake
the pastoral charge: but used to exchange with the Presbyterian
minister at Wisbeach, at those times when the Lord&rsquo;s Supper
was to be administered here; which must have been very
inconvenient to a man of his retired and recluse habits.&nbsp;
Like his father he exceeded any of our townsmen of his time in
many branches of knowledge, especially the mathematics.&nbsp; His
superior skill and judgement would accordingly be resorted to on
such difficult occasions as required extraordinary scientific
expertness or accuracy.&nbsp; In how many instances his townsmen
were indebted to his superior attainments, it is impossible now
to say: but the best <i>plan of the town</i> that has yet
appeared, with different views of it and of some of its principal
buildings, drawn by him, may be reckoned among those
instances.&nbsp; Except such productions we know not of any thing
else of his that has been published: nor do we know of any thing
from his exquisite pen that is now extant beside <i>his Account
of the Ejected Ministers</i>, in latin.&nbsp; Of this notable
production there are now in existence at least <i>three
copies</i>; two in his own hand writing, one of them deposited in
Dr. <i>Williams&rsquo; Library</i>, in London, and the other in
St. <i>Margaret&rsquo;s Library</i>, in Lynn: the latter written
with almost inimitable neatness.&nbsp; The third copy is a fair
transcript of the latter, in two different hands, and in the
possession of the present writer.&nbsp; It is entitled,
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Index</span> <i>Eorum Theologorum
Aliorumque</i> No. 2257.&nbsp; <a name="page1068"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1068</span><i>Qui propter Legem </i><span
class="smcap"><i>Uniformitatis</i></span>, <i>Aug:</i> 24
<i>An.</i> 1662, <i>ab Ecclesia Anglicana secesserunt</i>,
<i>Alphabetico ordine ac secundum gradus suos
depositus</i>.&nbsp; <i>Cura ac opera </i><span
class="smcap"><i>Gulielmi Rastrick</i></span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
follow, by way of motto, Zech. i. 5. in <i>Hebrew</i>; Heb. xi.
38, in <i>Greek</i>; a passage from <i>Erasmus</i> in
<i>Latin</i>; and one from <i>Locke</i>, in <i>English</i>.&nbsp;
At the bottom of the page stands 1734, denoting, as it would
seem, the year in which the MS. was written.&nbsp; Mr. W. R.
lived after that about 18 years, and died in the first week of
<i>August</i> 1752, just 25 years after his father; near to whose
grave, if not within the same, his remains are supposed to have
been deposited.&nbsp; He was buried on the 9th of that month, as
appears by the parish register.</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; <i>Anthony Mayhew</i>.&nbsp; He succeeded the former
as the minister of the congregation; and was a minister every way
worthy of such a predecessor; for a man of superior worthiness,
or of a more excellent character was rarely to be found any
where.&nbsp; He was a native of Suffolk, and had been many years
in the ministry, chiefly in Hampshire, if we are not mistaken,
before he settled in this town.&nbsp; After he had been here some
years the old chapel in Spinner-Lane was deserted, and a new one
erected in <i>Broad-Street</i>, where Mr. Isaac Allen now
officiates.&nbsp; He died Aug. 15, 1783 at the age of 76; about
six years after he had resigned his pastoral charge, when he was
succeeded by</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; <i>William Warner</i>.&nbsp; He was a person of a
most amiable disposition, and of respectable parts and
learning.&nbsp; He had been educated in London, under doctors
<i>Savage</i>, <a name="page1069"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1069</span><i>Kippis</i>, and <i>Rees</i>, and came to Lynn in
1777, by the recommendation of those eminent tutors, in
consequence of an application from Mr. Mayhew and the
congregation.&nbsp; He was here about three or four and twenty
years.&nbsp; His health had been deciding some years before he
died, which made him wish for a more favourably situation, which
at last offered itself, at Hapton near Norwich.&nbsp; But he
lived not long there; for he died early in 1802 <a
name="citation1069"></a><a href="#footnote1069"
class="citation">[1069]</a> at the age of 46.&nbsp; He was born
at or near <i>Nailsworth</i>, in Gloucestershire, where he is
supposed to have several near relations still living.&nbsp; He
married one of the daughters of his worthy predecessor Mr.
Mayhew, who still survives him, and is no way unworthy of such a
father and such a husband.&nbsp; His funeral sermon was preached
at Lynn by one who knew him intimately above twenty years, and
knew him to be a man without bigotry and without guile.&nbsp; The
congregation declined in his time, after his death the chapel, by
some odd management, went into the hands of the Calvinistic
Methodists, under the name of <i>Independents</i>, though it was
said to be the property of the Presbyterian Board in London.</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; Sir <i>Benjamin Keene</i>, Knight of the Bath, was
born at Lynn, in 1697.&nbsp; He was the eldest son of Charles
Keene, Esq; a merchant and alderman of this borough, who served
the office of Mayor in 1714&ndash;15.&nbsp; Young Keene was
probably educated at the Free School in this <a
name="page1070"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1070</span>town, and
was thence removed to Pembroke Hall in the University of
Cambridge, where he took his degree of civil law.&nbsp; He
afterwards continued his studies for a few years at Leyden.&nbsp;
It is said that the misfortunes of Mr. Keene, the father, in
trade, first recommended the family to the humanity and the
protection of Sir Robert Walpole, who afterwards acknowledged
that the talents and integrity of the son, in a public station of
peculiar difficulty, had more than repaid his beneficence.&nbsp;
In July 1724, Mr. Benjamin Keene was appointed the British Consul
at Madrid, and in 1727 Minister Plenipotentiary at the Spanish
Court.&nbsp; He was afterwards sent Envoy Extraordinary and
Plenipotentiary to the Court of Portugal, and then removed with
the character of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to
the Court of Spain.&nbsp; It was before observed, in the
biographical sketch of Sir R. Walpole, that it was the great and
meritorious object of that minister to preserve his country in a
state of peace: his instructions on this point appear to have
been executed by his pupil, Mr. Keene, with equal ability and
dignity.&nbsp; At an early period of the clamour on account of
what was called the Spanish Depredations, <a
name="citation1070"></a><a href="#footnote1070"
class="citation">[1070]</a> the origin of the differences, and
the difficulty of adjusting them, were thus clearly explained by
the Ambassador in a letter to the Secretary of State&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Upon the whole, the state of our dispute
seems to be, that the commanders of our vessels always think,
that they are unjustly taken, if they are not taken in
<i>actual</i> illicit commerce, even though proofs of their
having loaded in that manner are found upon them; and <a
name="page1071"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1071</span>the
Spaniards on the other hand presume, that they have a right of
seizing, not only the ships that are actually trading in their
ports, but likewise of examining and visiting them on the high
seas, in order to search, for proofs of fraud, which they may
have committed; and till a medium be found out between these two
notions, the government will always be embarrassed with
complaints, and we shall be continually negotiating in this
country for redress, without our being able to procure
it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No efforts were, however, to be left untried by the
parliamentary opponents of Walpole to force him into a war; and
while they incessantly inveighed against the pusillanimity of the
minister, they did not scruple to give their sanction to the most
exaggerated accounts of the insults permitted and exercised by
the Spaniards, and indeed to the most incredible tales of
horror.&nbsp; A transaction which had occurred seven years
before, and which was now worked up into &ldquo;the fable of
Jenkins&rsquo; ear,&rdquo; as Burke justly calls it, was made the
vehicle of popular frenzy; and it required the full exertion of
ministerial sagacity and influence to elude an immediate
rupture.&nbsp; The pacific overtures of Sir R. Walpole were most
ably seconded by Mr. Keene, whose address overcame the
dilatoriness, the punctilios, and the repugnance of the Spanish
Court; and a convention was signed at Madrid, which promised all
the advantages which the most successful warfare could have
procured.&nbsp; But no reasonable concession could satisfy the
people of England: their haughty and insulting language at length
disgusted and provoked the Spanish <a name="page1072"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1072</span>nation.&nbsp; The terms of the
convention were, in consequence, not fulfilled; Mr. Keene was
recalled, and the declaration of War against Spain was hailed in
England with a frantic enthusiasm.&nbsp; &ldquo;They now
<i>ring</i> the bells,&rdquo; was Sir Robert&rsquo;s observation,
&ldquo;but they will soon <i>wring</i> their hands.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Burke, whose veracity will not be doubted, declares that he had
seen and examined the original documents concerning these
important transactions, and that they had perfectly satisfied him
of the extreme injustice of this war with Spain.&nbsp; He even
says, &ldquo;some years after, it was my fortune to converse with
many of the principal actors against that minister, and with
those who principally excited that clamour.&nbsp; None of them,
no not one, did in the least defend the measure, or attempt to
justify their conduct, which they as freely condemned as they
would have done in commenting upon any proceeding in history, in
which they were totally unconcerned.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
sufficient to add, that after a disgraceful period of seven
years&rsquo; hostility, after a dreadful expense of blood and
treasure, the right of English Subjects to navigate in the
American Seas, the original source of the differences between us
and Spain, were not even mentioned in the articles of the ensuing
peace!!</p>
<p>Mr. Keene was again appointed to the same honourable station,
and in 1754 his majesty George the second was pleased to give a
fresh and public mark of approbation of the ambassador&rsquo;s
conduct, by dignifying him with the knighthood of the order of
the Bath; and as the king of Spain graciously performed the
ceremony <a name="page1073"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1073</span>of investing him with the ribband, Sir Benjamin, in
allusion to that particular ceremony, took for his motto
&ldquo;Regibus Amicis.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died at Madrid 15.
December 1757, at the time when he was about to return to
England, with a view of retiring from public employment, and to
be created a Peer of Great Britain. <a
name="citation1073a"></a><a href="#footnote1073a"
class="citation">[1073a]</a>&nbsp; His great abilities as a
minister, exercised and improved by long and important services;
the liberality and magnificence with which he supported the
dignity of his public character, without any attention to the
increase of his private fortune; and unusual esteem and affection
for his person, which his many amiable qualities procured him at
the court where he resided, were universally acknowledged, and
made his death, especially at that critical juncture, a real loss
to his country.&nbsp; His remains were brought over from Madrid,
and buried at Lynn, in St. Nicholas&rsquo; chapel, near his
beloved parents. <a name="citation1073b"></a><a
href="#footnote1073b" class="citation">[1073b]</a>&nbsp; <a
name="page1074"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1074</span>A

<p>20.&nbsp; Dr. <i>Edmund Keene</i>, a younger brother of Sir
Benjamin, was borne at Lynn in 1714.&nbsp; Through the interest
of Sir Robert Walpole he was educated at the Charter-House, and
thence admitted of Caius College, Cambridge in 1730.&nbsp; He was
elected Fellow in 1737, but afterwards he removed to St.
Peters&rsquo; college, on being appointed Fellow of that society
in 1739; and he was made Master of Peter-House in 1748.&nbsp; He
was elected Vice-chancellor of the university two succeeding
years, 1749 and 1750.&nbsp; In 1753 he was promoted to the see <a
name="page1075"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1075</span>of
Chester; <a name="citation1075"></a><a href="#footnote1075"
class="citation">[1075]</a> and in 1764 the Primacy of Ireland
was offered to him, which he declined: but (as it is related by
Bp. Newton in the account of his life,) &ldquo;he urged his
request to Mr. Grenville, that, upon the vacancy, he might
succeed to the see of Ely, which was the great object, the aim
and end of all his ambition.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1771, he
&ldquo;succeeded to his heart&rsquo;s desire, and happy it was
that he did so; for few could have borne the expense, or
displayed the taste and magnificence which he did, as he had a
liberal fortune, as well as liberal mind, and really merited the
appellation of a builder of palaces.&nbsp; For he built a new
palace at Chester, he built a new Ely-house in London, and in a
great measure a new palace at Ely, left only the outer walls
standing, formed a new inside, and thereby converted it into one
of the best episcopal houses, if not the very best in the
kingdom.&nbsp; He had indeed received the money which arose from
the <a name="page1076"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1076</span>sale of old Ely-house, and also what was paid by the
executors of his predecessor for dilapidation, which altogether
amounted to about 11,000<i>l.</i>&nbsp; But new houses require
new furniture.&rdquo;&mdash;Such is the detail of narrative old
age.&nbsp; Bp. Keene published only two or three sermons on the
usual state occasions: he is said to have been an attentive
prelate to his diocese, particularly in reserving to himself the
appointment of all the curates in those parishes which were
without a resident incumbent.&nbsp; He died in 1781.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; <i>Thomas Chesterton</i>.&nbsp; He was born at or
near Downham, in Norfolk, about the year 1715.&nbsp; When he was
of a proper age to be sent to school he was placed under the care
of a respectable clergyman in that neighbourhood, who had a
number of other pupils, the sons of reputable families, who
generally turned out well, and did him no small credit.&nbsp;
Among young Chesterton&rsquo;s schoolfellows there, were the late
revd. Thorogood Upwood, Mr. Philip Case, and others of equally
creditable connections.&nbsp; His superior genius for learning
was known and acknowledged by most of his fellow pupils, many of
whom in making their exercises were often not a little indebted
to his assistance.&nbsp; While in that seminary he was well
grounded in the rudiments of the Latin and Greek languages: nor
did that satisfy him, for he continued ever after to press
forward unweariedly for further literary improvement; till he
acquired an intimate and accurate knowledge, not only of the
Latin and Greek languages, but also of the Hebrew and its kindred
tongues, the Chaldee, Syriack <a name="page1077"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1077</span>and Arabick; of the latter of which
he composed a Grammar, which was well thought of by good
judges.&nbsp; He acquired likewise no slight knowledge of the
Persian, Coptic, and Ethiopic languages: so that it was not
without reason that some literary characters, even in the
establishment, who were well acquainted with his attainments,
looked upon him as one of the best scholars in this
county.&mdash;It should have been observed that after he left
school, being designed for the medical profession, he was placed
with a <i>Mr. Harvey</i>, a Surgeon and apothecary of very
extensive practice in this town.&nbsp; After he got out of his
time with Harvey, he married and went into business for himself:
and being well respected in the town he soon came into good
practice.&nbsp; Having from the first been a frequent attendant
on the ministry of the younger Rastrick, he by degrees imbibed
his principles and became a decided nonconformist.&nbsp;
Afterwards, in consequence of having some scruples about infant
baptism, he renounced that practice, professed himself a Baptist,
and joined a Society of that denomination at Downham.&nbsp; He
was soon after encouraged to engage in the ministry, and having
an invitation to settle with a congregation at Colnbrook in
Buckinghamshire, he accepted the same and removed to that place,
where he continued several years.&nbsp; He afterwards resigned
his pastoral charge there, and removed to London where he
followed his medical profession (as he had also done at
Colnbrook) and preached occasionally.&nbsp; The congregation he
was now chiefly connected with was that which met in Eagle Street
under the ministry of the late Dr. Grifford of the British <a
name="page1078"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1078</span>Museum.&nbsp; His health now declining, and his
property at Lynn and other parts of Norfolk requiring a nearer
residence, he returned back to this town about 1765, after an
absence in all of about ten years.&nbsp; He now resumed the
medical practice, chiefly to introduce his son into business, who
was brought up to the same profession.&nbsp; It so happened at
this juncture that the people who had formerly seceded from Mr.
Rastrick&rsquo;s congregation, and had formed a sort of
Independent society, were without a minister: their late
minister, William Eltringham, commonly called <i>captain</i>
Eltringham, having removed from them to another
congregation.&nbsp; These people invited him to become their
minister, and he accepted their invitation.&nbsp; But he was not
long comfortable among them.&nbsp; They soon became as
unsatisfied with him as they had been with Mr. Rastrick, though
not on the same pretence.&nbsp; The connection between him and
them was consequently dissolved.&nbsp; His health was now
declining so fast, that he was obliged to relinquish the ministry
and every other active employment.&nbsp; After languishing for
some time, and mostly in most excruciating pains, he died on the
10th of May 1770, at the age of 54.&nbsp; His disorder was said
to be an ulcer in the bladder.&nbsp; He was pretty highly
orthodox, but, by all accounts, a very pious, as well as a very
learned man.</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; <i>David Lloyd</i>, L.L.D.&nbsp; He was a native of
Cilcennin in Cardiganshire.&nbsp; After having spent some time at
school in that neighbourhood he was sent to the grammar school at
Caermarthen, then a very reputable seminary.&nbsp; He went
afterwards to Jesus College in Oxford, <a
name="page1079"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1079</span>where he
took the degree of L.L.B. and afterwards that of L.L.D. <a
name="citation1079"></a><a href="#footnote1079"
class="citation">[1079]</a>&nbsp; After having acquitted himself
very creditably as usher at some school in the vicinity of the
metropolis, he was chosen master of the Lynn Grammar School in
1760; which situation he filled with great reputation to himself,
and equal advantage to his pupils for the long space of 34
years.&nbsp; It does not appear that this school was ever in so
flourishing a state under any other master, unless it was in the
time of Mr. <i>Horne</i>, who was so long at the head of it, as
was before observed.&nbsp; Dr. LL. was unwearied in his attention
to the literary improvement of the youth placed under his care,
and to the forming of them to be useful members of society in the
different departments for which they were designed; in which he
appears to have been in no small degree successful, as may be
seen by the number of those who were once his pupils and now
usefully occupy very respectable stations of life.&nbsp; The
Doctor went into orders late in life; (at the age of 50 or
upwards) and having no preferment in the church he preached but
seldom, confining himself entirely to the duties of his other
profession.&nbsp; He died in 1794, and was buried in the chancel
of St. Margaret&rsquo;s church.&nbsp; A stone with the following
inscription marks his grave&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>Sacred to the Memory

F.R.C.P. Edinb. was another of the former inhabitants of Lynn who
deserved well of his fellow townsmen and of the public at
large.&nbsp; He was born at Edinburgh Dec. 17. 1721; and was a
younger son of James Hamilton, who was bred to the law, and was
at one time deputy keeper of Holyrood-House, under James Duke of
Hamilton, its hereditary keeper.&nbsp; He was educated at the
High School in his native city, and was there at the time of the
memorable affair of captain Porteus.&nbsp; When of a proper age
he was placed with a surgeon and apothecary at Leith, where he
remained three years.&nbsp; After having attended the lectures of
different professors at the university, upon the materia medica,
pharmacy, botany, anatomy, surgery, &amp;c. he was at length
obliged to quit these studies, and procured a birth on board the
Somerset man of war in 1741, having previously undergone the
usual examination at Surgeon&rsquo;s Hall, London.&nbsp; He
continued in that line, or as a navy-surgeon, for about seven
years, when the peace of Aix-la-chapelle put him out of
employment.&nbsp; He came to Lynn in 1748, to see a brother who
was married here and settled as a merchant; and having heard of,
and engaged a situation at the neighbouring village of Great
Massingham, where there was a vacancy for a surgeon and
apothecary, he settled there in August that same year, but
continued there only till October 1749, when he removed and
settled at Lynn: and not long after he married a Miss Hawkins,
the sister of his brother&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; He now went into
business, in partnership with Mr. Young, a grandson of Dr.
Hepburn.&nbsp; A vacancy for a <a name="page1081"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1081</span>physician happening here in 1765 by
the death of Dr. Lidderdale, he was advised to procure a doctors
degree, in order to become his successor, which advice he at
length complied with, and in May 1766 received that honour from
St. Andrew&rsquo;s, the diploma being signed by no less than ten
professors.&mdash;Not long after he relinquished the practice of
pharmacy, and pursued those of physic and midwifery, which he
followed the remainder of his life, with considerable applause,
and general approbation.&nbsp; He died Nov. 9. 1793, and was
buried in St. Nicholas&rsquo; chapel, regretted by a large
portion of the community. <a name="citation1081"></a><a

1082</span>Before we entirely close this part of the work, and
proceed to the <i>conclusion</i>, or to give a <i>view of the
present state of the town</i>, it may not be improper here, by
way of <i>Postscript</i>, to rectify some slight mistakes, and to
supply certain omissions that have been discovered in different
parts of the preceding sections, since the sheets have been
printed off.</p>
<p>In the first place, the author wishes he had, at page 137,
somewhat enlarged the memoir of that eminent president of the R.
S. <i>Martin Folkes Esq</i>; the maternal grandfather of Martin
Folkes Rishton Esq; of this town; and especially that he had more
particularly noticed that ingenious, elaborate, and masterly
publication of his, the <i>Tables</i> &ldquo;of the <i>English
Silver-coins</i>, from the Norman conquest to the present
time;&rdquo; and &ldquo;of the <i>English Gold Coins</i> from the
18th. of Edward III, when gold was first coined in England, to
the present time.&rdquo;&nbsp; The work is comprised in one
volume quarto, and was printed in 1745, for the society of
Antiquaries.&nbsp; It is a work of the highest authority, and of
the greatest use and importance to those who wish to be
thoroughly <a name="page1083"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1083</span>acquainted with the subject there treated of; and
might, perhaps, he consulted with no small advantage by our
senators and others in the present precarious state of our
currency.</p>
<p>At page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page961">961</a></span>, the author now finds that he was
mistaken in saying that <i>both the old members</i> were returned
at the contested election 1784.&nbsp; <i>Walpole</i> indeed was
returned with Molineux, yet not the old member of that name, but
a relation of his, who for a long while after continued to be one
of our representatives; to what benefit or advantage to the town
or nation, the present writer is not able to say.&mdash;The
author has been blamed for passing over in silence the <i>Ball
and Supper</i> given at our Town-Hall in <i>commemoration of the
Revolution</i>, on the 14th. of November 1788, pronounced, as it
is said, by both Mr. and Mrs Coke to have been &ldquo;<i>equal in
Splendor</i> and <i>more comfortable than that given at
Holkham</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fact is, the author had quite
forgotten it; and as it was kept so much <i>out of time</i>, he
is still inclined to think that it was given more out of vain
parade, than, out of real gratitude for that great and
interesting event.&mdash;Another omission the author has been
reminded of is, &ldquo;that in April 1797, <i>prince William</i>
(now duke) of <i>Gloucester</i> visited Lynn, and after reviewing
the Volunteers, and dining with the mayor, was presented with the
freedom of this ancient borough.&rdquo;&mdash;The execution of
<i>Peter Donahue</i>, serjeant in the 30th. regiment of foot, for
forgery at Lynn in 1801 is another omission suggested to the
author; and also the condemnation of <i>Robert Nichols</i>, the
year after, for sheep stealing: to which might have been added
the fatal disaster of the Ferry-boat, this present year, by which
ten persons at least perished.&mdash;It will be the
author&rsquo;s endeavour to set all these matters right in a
Table of remarkable events at the end of the work.</p>
<h3><a name="page1084"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1084</span>CHAP. VII.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Impartial view of the <i>present state</i> of
the town and its vicinity: containing introductory observations,
brief account of churches, chapels, almshouses, workhouses,
charitable and social institutions, religious sects and
confraternities, the corporation, the shipping, trade and
commerce, exports and imports, population, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>This town, or at least its western vicinity, being that part
of Marshland that lies contiguous to the town, has of late
experienced an unexpected and most striking change, in the sudden
resort thither and settlement of a number of characters in high
life, consisting of peers, courtiers, statesmen, nabobs, royal
physicians, naval and military commanders, &amp;c.&nbsp; This may
be reckoned among the wonders of these eventful times.&nbsp; It
is marvellous in the eyes of most people, and has filled all
Marshland with astonishment, so as to make its homely and
unlettered inhabitants ready to lift up their voices and cry out
with the ancient Lycaonians, &ldquo;The gods are come down to us
in the likeness of men!&rdquo;&mdash;or with a celebrated English
poet, &ldquo;Descending gods find their Elysium <a
name="page1085"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1085</span>here!&rdquo; <a name="citation1085"></a><a
href="#footnote1085" class="citation">[1085]</a>&mdash;The
enormous price given by these new-comers for the estates they
have purchased has greatly astonished the whole country, being
about double the current valuation, or what lands usually fetched
here before: and as some of them are said to be deep in political
and state secrets, these purchases have excited strong suspicions
of the tottering existence and depreciating state of all funded
property.&nbsp; For had such property been really safe and good,
these sagacious persons would hardly have withdrawn theirs and
thus deliberately bury it in the bogs of Marshland.</p>
<p>Those changes also that have recently taken place
<i>within</i> the town are many of them very curious and
striking.&nbsp; The late improvements in the Streets, by the new
paving of them, &amp;c. might indeed be pronounced proper and
commendable, had not the expense fallen so heavy upon that large
portion of the community who were quite unable to bear the
pressure of any additional imposts, and could hardly stand under
the weight of those that had been previously imposed.&nbsp; Here
the projectors and promoters of the scheme appear in a very
unfavourable light&mdash;inconsiderate and unfeeling in a very
high degree.&nbsp; But it is in their rage <a
name="page1086"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1086</span>for
<i>innovation</i> they appear in the queerest light.&nbsp;
Considering what they have done in that way, it seems really a
wonder that the very name of the town itself has escaped them, or
that they did not take it into their heads to bestow upon it some
new and whimsical appellation, as they have done to almost every
part of it, and even some of principal Streets.&nbsp; <i>Checker
Street</i>, for instance, has been by them called <i>King
Street</i>, though it had borne the former name for many
ages.&nbsp; The <i>Grass Market</i> and <i>Damgate</i>, which
were always before considered as <i>two</i> distinct Streets,
(and had borne those names perhaps 500 years, if not much longer)
are by them converted into <i>one</i>, and called <i>Norfolk
Street</i>; a name that might with equal propriety have been
given to <i>Broad Street</i>, or <i>High Street</i>, or any other
Street in the town.&nbsp; All this, if not superlatively
fantastical and absurd, is certainly childish and ridiculous
enough.&nbsp; But we will pursue the subject no further.</p>
<p>Among the recent changes in the town, those that have taken
place in the <i>Workhouse</i> and the <i>Hall</i> must not be
here forgotten or overlooked.&nbsp; The new order of things in
the former place, (the <i>Workhouse</i>,) is expected to produce
a saving to the town, to no small amount, without any material
detriment to the paupers, that are there maintained: and this
expectation, it is to be hoped, will not issue in disappointment,
like too many of our former golden dreams.&nbsp; As to the
<i>Hall</i>, the spirit of economy and retrenchment seems to have
become there now quite triumphant.&nbsp; Such public days <a
name="page1087"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1087</span>as those
of <i>St. John</i> and <i>St. Michael</i>, so remarkable
heretofore for festivity and hilarity, are now become like days
of fasting and humiliation.&nbsp; Not only the sumptuous dinners
and convivialities of former times have now totally disappeared,
but even the poor pittance of a bit of cake and a glass of wine,
has been actually withheld, even from the worshipful members
whose attendance on those days was indispensable, and who may be
looked upon as the very pillars and atlases of our ancient
municipal constitution.&nbsp; After all it is not meant here to
censure this new frugal plan.&nbsp; It may be very necessary and
highly proper, as the world goes; for it certainly corresponds
with the complexion and exigencies of the times, which require
the strictest economy and utmost frugality from almost every
description of our dear countrymen, to enable them to go on with
any prospect of success or comfort.&nbsp; But here it was only
meant to state a historical fact, too remarkable to be entirely
overlooked.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> I.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Brief account of the Churches and
Chapels</i>.</p>
<p>In an account of the churches of Lynn, the first place, no
doubt, is due to that of <span class="smcap">St. Margaret</span>,
which was founded about the close of the 11<i>th</i>, or
commencement of the 12<i>th</i> century, by Herbert de Lozinga
bishop of Norwich; memorable for his simoniacal offences, and
subsequent architectural expiations.&nbsp; Among the latter were
the <i>cathedral</i> and episcopal <i>palace</i> at Norwich, <a
name="page1088"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1088</span>the great
church of <i>St. Nicholas</i> at Yarmouth, and this of St.
<i>Margaret</i> at Lynn.&nbsp; The latter according to a certain
ancient deed or register was built by him <i>at the request of
the men of the town of Lynn</i>.&nbsp; But if that was the case,
it seems their contributions proved by no means adequate to the
magnitude or exigences of the undertaking; for the work it seems
went but slowly and heavily on, till he had recourse to that
notable and wonderful expedient of offering forty days pardon, or
an indulgence for that time in all manner of licentious or
vicious courses, to all who would contribute towards the
completion of the sacred edifice.&nbsp; The work then went on
prosperously, was soon finished in a magnificent style, and the
indulgence effected what an appeal to the most pious
considerations would probably have failed to accomplish.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

title=
"St. Margaret&rsquo;s church, King&rsquo;s Lynn"
 src="images/p1087s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Herbert dedicated this edifice to <i>St. Margaret the
virgin</i>, <a name="citation1088"></a><a href="#footnote1088"
class="citation">[1088]</a> or, as some say, to saint <i>Mary
Magdalen</i>, St. <a name="page1089"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1089</span>Margaret and all the virgin saints; which probably
made Mr. Britton in the Beauties of England call it St.
<i>Mary&rsquo;s church</i>, a name which does not appear to have
been given to it by any body else.&nbsp; This church has been so
often re-edified and repaired since its first erection, that but
a small part of it, as it now stands, is supposed to be as old as
the days of Lozinga.&nbsp; If there be any, it seems to be
towards the west, or south-west end, where the style of
architecture appears to bespeak much higher antiquity than any
other part, according to the opinion of the best judges.</p>
<p>The church in its original state is supposed to have been of
greater dimensions, as well as more magnificent, than it is at
present; and it was certainly the case in later ages, and until
the last century, when the spire fell on the body of the church
and demolished a great part of it.&nbsp; This happened in
1741.&nbsp; Soon after the eastern tower lanthorn was taken down,
from a fear (groundless it seems) that it might also fall, as the
spire had done, and occasion irreparable damage.&nbsp; It was
therefore done to preserve the eastern part of the church.&nbsp;
The West end being demolished by the fall of the spire, an act of
Parliament was procured for re-building the body of the
church.&nbsp; The king, it is said, contributed a thousand
pounds, and lord Orford 500<i>l.</i> towards the work; and it was
completed in 1747. <a name="citation1089"></a><a
href="#footnote1089" class="citation">[1089]</a>&nbsp; It is much
<a name="page1090"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1090</span>smaller than the former, but is still one of the
largest and handsomest parish churches in the kingdom:&mdash;it
also abounds with the tombs of our principal townsmen <a
name="page1091"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1091</span>of other
times; (and so do the other churches of St. Nicholas and
All-saints,) with endless monumental inscriptions, which those
who are fond of such compositions may find at large in
<i>Mackerell&rsquo;s</i> volume, which contains little
else.&nbsp; But they would take up too much room in this
work.&nbsp; This church had formerly at least three chapels
attached to it, or comprehended in it: one dedicated to the
<i>Trinity</i>, one to <i>St. John</i>, and one if we are not
mistaken, to <i>St. Stephen</i>; only one or two <a
name="page1092"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1092</span>of which
now remain.&nbsp; That of the <i>Trinity</i> was taken down very
lately, in the progress of our paving-act improvements: and long
before that the whole north side of the church-yard was laid open
and made a part of the street, or market place.&nbsp; A new
burying-ground, however, of a much larger extent, has been since
laid out adjoining to St. James&rsquo;s Church-yard, on which a
neat small chapel has been erected, merely for the purpose of
reading the burial service.&nbsp; Had the friends of the
establishment contrived to build it on a larger scale, in order
to have divine service there on Sunday evenings, it might have
answered a very good purpose; and such a place would have been
much filter for delivering evening lectures than either of the
two great churches, both of which were originally constructed for
very different purposes, it is to this omission of having evening
lectures in the churches, that the methodists and other
dissenters owe their crowded audiences, and not to the greater
purity of their creeds, or the superior abilities and
respectability of their ministers.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">St. Nicholas&rsquo;s
Chapel</span>.&nbsp; Both <i>Mackerell</i> and <i>Parkin</i> have
employed their pens in describing this respectable fabrick.&nbsp;
But a much better account of it, and the best, no doubt, that has
ever yet been given, came from the pen of the <i>revd. Edward
Edwards</i>, one of the present ministers of the town, and has
appeared in the 7th. number of the 3rd. volume of
<i>Britton&rsquo;s Architectural Antiquities</i>.&nbsp; From that
and other accounts we learn, that this chapel, was built in the
latter part of the 14th century on the site of another erected
about <a name="page1093"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1093</span>two centuries before, and of much smaller
dimensions.&nbsp; Mackerell seemed much puzzled to determine to
what Nicholas this sacred building had been dedicated, whether
<i>the proselyte of Antioch</i>, mentioned in the book of Acts,
or <i>the bishop of Myra</i> of the same name, who so stoutly
opposed the Arians at the Council of Nice.&nbsp; After all, it
seems not very likely that it was either of them, but a namesake
of theirs, of a much more modern date. <a
name="citation1093"></a><a href="#footnote1093"

which few of the readers of this work will feel themselves much

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It measures (says Mr. Edwards) 194 feet in
length from East to West, within the walls, and about 74 feet in
breadth; having no transept or distinct choir.&nbsp; The interior
consists of a lofty nave, with two lateral ailes.&nbsp; The
latter are divided from the former by eleven arches on the north
side, and ten on the south:&mdash;the space of one arch at the
S.W. angle being occupied by the base of the tower.&nbsp; The
place of another arch, at the east end, is taken up by a vestry
on the south side, and a similar apartment, over the vault of Sir
Benjamin Keene, towards the north, leaving a kind of recess
between, of the whole width of the nave, for the communion
table.&nbsp; The distinguishing characters of this structure, as
seen within, are lightness, simplicity, and perfect uniformity of
style; the <i>tower</i> alone being of an earlier date than the
rest of the fabric.&nbsp; The pillars are slender, having the
horizontal section of the shaft nearly in the form of a truncated
lozenge, relieved by shallow flutings, and raised about four feet
from the ground upon corresponding bases.&nbsp; They have no
capitals, but small brackets which support <a
name="page1095"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1095</span>the inner
ribs of the Arches.&nbsp; Opposite the arches, in the side ailes,
are an equal number of windows: between the windows are niches
and canopies.&nbsp; The east and west windows are very large,
with a pleasing mixture of curved and rectilinear tracery, and
embattled ornaments upon the transoms.&nbsp; The former is
divided into nine days, or lights, by eight vertical mullions,
and the latter has eleven-days, or vertical compartments of
glass.&nbsp; More ornament has been bestowed upon the
<i>doors</i> than on any other part of the building.&nbsp; The
western door-way in particular, is divided by a mullion which
supports an elegant niche, and is adorned with other sculpture in
stone.&nbsp; The small south door-way is in the same style, as is
also the larger door-way towards the north.&nbsp; The front of
the <i>South Porch</i> is still more elaborate, being covered
with a variety of minute decorations.&nbsp; The roof of it is
handsomely groined with stone.&nbsp; At the intersection of the
ribs are some heads and figures in bold relief, but much obscured
with whitening: in the centre is a figure of the Almighty Father
with a globe in one hand, and the other lifted up as in the act
of blessing those who approach his temple. <a
name="citation1095"></a><a href="#footnote1095"
class="citation">[1095]</a>&nbsp; In the circle surrounding this
compartment appear to be angels in the act of adoration; and at a
little distance towards the windows, are two crowned heads <a
name="page1096"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1096</span>of a male
and female, which might be intended for Edward III and his queen
Philippa.&nbsp; The inner roof of the chapel is of oak, in a
plain and simple style, yet with a sufficiency of ornament to
harmonize with the rest of the building.&nbsp; The beams and
cornices and relieved with carvings of the strawberry leaf, which
was so great a favourite with our ancestors; and overall the
upper windows there were originally figures of angels with
outspread wings, represented as playing on various musical
instruments.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original chapel, built by bishop Turbus, or de Turbe,
about the time of king Stephen, (the middle or latter part of the
12th century,) having proved too small for the accommodation of
the inhabitants, it is understood to have been taken down and
rebuilt upon its present scale, in the latter part of Edward the
3rd&rsquo;s reign, and of the 14th century: &ldquo;For the
pope&rsquo;s bull to that effect is stated by Parkin (p. 595) to
have been granted to the mayoralty of Jeffrey Tall, or Talbooth,
who served that office in 1371 and 1379.&nbsp; And it is recorded
that in the latter year, pope Urban VI sent his bull hither,
which was received with great veneration, to authorise and allow
the baptizing of infants and others in this chapel.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This is supported by the authority of Parkin and Mackerell, and
corroborated by the gravestone and history of William de
Bittering.&nbsp; Moreover &ldquo;the figures of a lion and an
eagle upon the summit of the South porch, are thought to be the
armorial supporters of Edward III: and there was very lately in
the centre of the west window, a figure greatly resembling the
usual portraits of that monarch, with three crowns upon his
sceptre.&nbsp; <a name="page1097"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1097</span>The ornaments which surmount the two canopied niches
in the buttresses on each side of the western door, also appear
very like the crest of the same king, as it is represented in his
first gold coin, the quarter florin.&rdquo;&mdash;[see
Folkes&rsquo; Tables p. 121.]&mdash;Repeated efforts were made to
render both the original chapel and the present one independent
of the mother church; but those attempts were always opposed and
frustrated by the bishop.&nbsp; But it really seemed sometimes to
be considered as independent by the inhabitants; and the
<i>parish of St. Nicholas</i> occurs in old records as distinct
from that of St. Margaret: and in the reign of Philip and Mary
the extent of each parish, and the limits or boundary that
divided them appear to have been accurately marked out.&nbsp;
Afterwards, however, the managers of St. Nicholas&rsquo; parish
were found to encroach on their neighbours of St. Margaret; which
produced a dispute between them that occasioned the interference
of the Hall to put a stop to it, by declaring afresh the proper
bounds of each parish.&nbsp; This happened in 1585, as appears
from a passage in an old record, now in the hands of this writer,
mostly extracted, as he thinks, from the Hall-Books of those
times. <a name="citation1097"></a><a href="#footnote1097"
class="citation">[1097]</a>&nbsp; About fourteen years after, as
we learn from the same document the <a name="page1098"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1098</span>corporation&rsquo;s title to St.
Nicholas&rsquo; <i>church yard</i> was seriously disputed, but it
is not said by whom. <a name="citation1098"></a><a
href="#footnote1098" class="citation">[1098]</a>&nbsp; The last
effort to establish the independency of this church and parish
was in 1609, but it was then crushed by the consistory court at
Norwich, and set for ever at rest.&nbsp; At present the two
ministers serve this church and that of St. Margaret alternately;
and it would be no very easy matter, perhaps, to find any two
churches that are better served.&nbsp; At the general dissolution
of the monasteries, the impropriation of these churches was
purchased by the corporation; but it seems that the provision
they made for the ministers was more ample formerly than it has
been latterly.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">All-hallows</span>, otherwise
<span class="smcap">All-saints</span>, or <i>South Lynn
Church</i>.&nbsp; <i>Mackerell</i>, from its nearness to the site
of their convent, infers that &ldquo;that this church did
formerly belong to the <i>Carmelites</i> or White
Friars&rdquo;&mdash;he might as well have inferred that St.
James&rsquo;s formerly belonged to the Grey Friars, and St.
Nicholas&rsquo;s to the Augustinians, as they stand equally near
to the sites of their convents.&nbsp; He also informs us that it
has been used for a parish church, ever since the abolition of
the Carmelite convent; as if South Lynn, (or <i>Suthsoken</i> as
it was anciently called) had been without a parish church till
the reign of Henry the 8th; than which there cannot be a more
groundless supposition.&nbsp; Of its <i>former state</i>, in
other respects, his account is more correct: &ldquo;This <a
name="page1099"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1099</span>fabrick
(says he,) though it cannot be said to be large, yet it is a
neat, regular, and solid structure, built in the form of a cross,
within a fair cemetery, or church-yard, well walled and fenced
in.&nbsp; The steeple is square and flat, with proper battlements
round it.&nbsp; In the middle is a streight pinnacle, upon which
is placed a weather-cock, and has five tuneable bells.&nbsp; Here
are two convenient porticos, one on the south side, and the other
at the west end.&nbsp; The dimensions of the whole here
follow&mdash;From east to west within, 139 feet; from north to
south, 48 feet; length of the cross isle, 83 feet; height of the
steeple, 83 feet; height of the spire, 31 feet.&nbsp; The body
consists of three alleys, and in a cross isle besides the quire
are very many grave-stones for <i>monks</i>, and others, [of the
different orders of friars] who came thither about the reign of
Henry III, and here settled, building themselves convents in
different parts of the town&rdquo; [as divers protestant sects
have also done in more recent times.]&mdash;Of this Edifice, in
its more modern state <i>Parkin</i> says; &ldquo;This church is
dedicated to <i>All Saints</i>: it is a regular pile built in
form of a cross, with 3 isles and a chancel, covered with lead;
the whole being about 140 feet long; breadth 48 feet; cross isle
83 feet long.&nbsp; At the west end was a strong tower&mdash;and
5 tuneable bells.&nbsp; The tower fell down in 1763, and part of
the end of the church, which is now repaired with a strong brick
wall; on the top of which is a kind of cupola of wood, &amp;c. in
which hangs one small bell.&mdash;At the dissolution this
impropriate rectory being in the crown, was assigned to the Lady
Mary (afterward queen Mary) and was valued 11<i>l.</i> 0<i>s.</i>
9<i>d.</i>&mdash;[a very small sum compared with its <a
name="page1100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1100</span>present
value, or annual product.]&nbsp; In the 20th. of James I. it was
possessed by Sir John Jolleys,&rdquo; [and at present by Sir
Martin Browne Folkes bart.]&nbsp; The <i>vicarage</i> is in the
gift of the bishop of Ely; but is a very poor one, and said to be
worth very little if any thing more now than it was 150 years
ago.</p>

</a></p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Old Lynn</span>, or <i>West
Lynn</i> Church; otherwise <i>West Lynn St. Peters</i>.&nbsp;
This edifice, as its last name implies, is dedicated to <i>St.
Peter</i>; meaning, as we presume, the apostle so called.&nbsp;
It stands on the western bank of the Ouse, nearly opposite to St.
Margaret&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It is not the original church of old
Lynn; nor does it stand on the same spot: that stood to the east
of it, and within the present bed of the river.&nbsp; It is said
to have been destroyed, together with the church-yard, about the
56th. of Henry III, or 1271, by an <i>inundation of the sea</i>;
or rather, perhaps, by the vast <i>increase of fresh water</i> in
this harbour, from the addition of the Grant, the Ouse, and the
Nene, about that time, to those other rivers which before had
their passage to the sea by this town.&nbsp; The present church,
it seems, was erected very soon after, on a piece of ground which
the rector, William Pakenham, had procured for that purpose; who,
to avoid all disputes, allowed the former patron, the prior of
Lewes, the soil or ground, and the right of patronage.&nbsp; To
this new church was afterwards added a <i>chapel</i> dedicated to
<i>our Lady</i>, in which was <i>her image</i>: also a chauntry,
endowed with much land and divers tenements; all which was seized
by the crown at the dissolution, and granted afterwards to the <a
name="page1101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1101</span>L&rsquo;estranges of Hunstanton.&nbsp; This church is
a rectory:&mdash;it is covered (says Parkin) with lead, and the
chancel with reed; and he adds, &ldquo;it has a square tower with
3 bells.&rdquo;&nbsp; So much for this consecrated fabric.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">North Lynn</span> <i>church</i>,
or, (as we may call it) <i>Lynn St. Edmund&rsquo;s</i>, from its
being dedicated to a royal saint of that name.&nbsp; Of this
sacred structure not a vestige now remains.&nbsp; We have been
able to discover neither the time when it was built, nor yet when
it disappeared.&nbsp; But it was probably built soon after the
death, or canonization of <i>king Edmund</i>, called the
<i>martyr</i>, to whom it was dedicated.&nbsp; It seems to have
stood many ages; for it was standing in the latter part of the
reign of Henry VII; and it probably stood a good while after
that; even to the time of the reformation or later.&nbsp; It
appears from Parkin&rsquo;s account, that it was standing at the
beginning of the 16th century; for John Byrd, the then rector,
and who calls himself <i>parson of</i> <span class="GutSmall">OLD
LYNN</span>, (which, by the bye, seems to imply that the name of
<i>old Lyn</i> was then applied to both parishes,) by his will
dated 1505, wills to be buried in the chancel of this
church.&nbsp; This proves that it was then standing, and that
there was no apprehension entertained of its being in any great
danger of falling, or of being swallowed up by the waters.&nbsp;
Yet it certainly underwent that catastrophe sometime after though
perhaps not very soon: so that both church and church-yard were
completely swept away.&nbsp; It is supposed they stood in the
present bed of the river, somewhere nearly opposite to the fort,
or the block-house.&nbsp; Since that period the North-Lynn <a
name="page1102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1102</span>rectory
has been a <i>sine cure</i>.&nbsp; Repeated attempts, if are not
mistaken, have been made since (though in vain) to have this
benefice bestowed on the corporation, for the better maintenance
of the ministers of the town.&nbsp; One of those attempts was
made in the reign of Charles I, as is evinced by the following
extract from the Hall-books&mdash;&ldquo;1647, <i>Dec.</i>
17.&nbsp; <i>Ordered a Letter to Mr. Alderman Toll and Mr.
Recorder</i>, <i>to acquaint them with the death of Mr.
Scott</i>, <i>minister of North-Lyn</i>, <i>and to get that
living by some means to be bestowed on this town toward the
maintenance of the ministers thereof</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;The
present incumbent, being also one of the ministers of the town,
the object then had in view may be said to be in some measure
secured during his life-time.&nbsp; But it is not certain, or
even very likely, that it will be secured any further.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> II.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Brief account of the different dissenting
chapels in this town</i>.</p>
<p>Of all our present sects the <i>Jews</i> and the
<i>Catholics</i> seem to claim the precedence in point of
antiquity.&nbsp; The former composed a part of the population of
Lynn at a pretty remote period; and the treatment they here
experienced ought to be spoken of only in terms of the utmost
reprobation.&nbsp; They were pillaged and massacred in the most
brutal manner, and had their very habitations <a
name="page1103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1103</span>burnt and
destroyed, as has been related in a former part of this work. <a
name="citation1103"></a><a href="#footnote1103"
class="citation">[1103]</a>&nbsp; There are still some Jewish
families resident here; and we believe they have always had a
synagogue in the town.&nbsp; It was for many years in Tower
Street; but that has been lately pulled down, being part of the
premises which the <i>Methodists</i> have purchased for the
purpose of erecting there their intended magnificent and
capacious temple.&nbsp; We have not learnt that the Jews have yet
been able to procure another synagogue; but we may suppose that
they will not be long without it.&nbsp; At present they probably
meet in some private apartment fitted up for the purpose, till a
more suitable place can be obtained.</p>
<p>As to the <span class="smcap">Catholics</span>, they were
formerly our predominant sect, and constituted the established
church of England and of Lynn, for near a thousand years.&nbsp;
They have long been reduced here to a small society, and are not
at present likely to become more numerous or considerable.&nbsp;
They have generally a priest stationed among them.&nbsp; Their
present chapel is a small room in Ferry Street, and those who
attend are, of course, but few in number.&nbsp; The present
minister is a French emigrant, of fair character, and very well
respected in this town, to whom many of our townsmen are indebted
for the proficiency they have made in the knowledge of the French
language.&nbsp; The Roman Catholic religion being no longer the
religion of the state, it has ceased to be oppressive or
formidable to our other religious communities; and <a
name="page1104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1104</span>it is
supposed to have lost (at least in these kingdoms) much of that
intolerant and sanguinary character which distinguished its
professors in former times.&nbsp; By many the Catholics in these
realms, and especially in Ireland, are thought an oppressed
people; and it is much to be wished that every just reason for
such an opinion might entirely be done away.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; That respectable body of protestant Dissenters, who
have assumed the name of <span class="smcap">Friends</span>, and
are by others called <i>Quakers</i>, have long had a place of
worship in this town, and formed a reputable part of its
population.&nbsp; It seems that some of our townsmen have been of
that denomination ever since the year 1655.&nbsp; <i>George
Fox</i> himself visited this town in the course of that year, and
preached here with considerable effect.&nbsp; A Person was sent
about the town to apprize the inhabitants of his arrival, and
invite them to give him a hearing, especially the more sober and
pious part of them, together with the officers of the
garrison.&nbsp; A large congregation appears to have assembled,
many of whom were much affected by the sermon: consequently, as
we learn from Fox&rsquo;s Journal, a fine meeting or congregation
was formed here, &ldquo;<i>who had come from the hireling
teachers to sit under the teaching of the Lord Jesus
Christ</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; From that time to this it is supposed
that there has always existed here a society of Friends or
Quakers.&nbsp; Fox, however, was not the first of that
Denomination who visited Lynn.&nbsp; It was visited, as
<i>Sewel</i> informs us, by <i>Thomas Briggs</i> two years
before, who warned the people to repent, but appears not to have
been much listened to, <a name="page1105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1105</span>and even to have met a very
unchristian reception&mdash;&ldquo;a great mastiff (says Sewel,)
was set upon him; but the dog coming near, fawned upon him, and
would do him no harm:&rdquo; so that the poor brute behaved to
him much better than those of his own species.&nbsp; But it has
often so happened to those who endeavoured to reform the world
and turn mankind from the errors of their ways.&nbsp; Fox visited
Lynn again in 1662, when some of his Friends were confined here
in prison.&nbsp; We find that he preached here then with
acceptance; which was, probably, what excited the magistrates to
have him apprehended and imprisoned; but before they could effect
their cruel purpose, he escaped out of their jurisdiction.&nbsp;
Where those of his persuasion held their meetings here in those
troublesome times does not appear, but they afterwards met in the
Cross Yard near Lady Bridge, which continued to be their place of
worship till the erection of their present place in New Conduit
Street.&nbsp; This is a neat, but small place; though quite large
enough for their congregation, which is supposed to be now much
smaller than it has been in former times, as is also the case in
most parts of the kingdom&mdash;the modern Quakers having but a
small portion of that zeal in disseminating their principles
which was manifested by their early ancestors.&nbsp; This is to
be regretted, as some of those principles are certainly very
excellent, and deserve every possible exertion to disseminate
them throughout the world.&nbsp; Of the particular tenets of the
Quakers a full account may be found in <i>Barclay&rsquo;s
Apology</i>, and also in <i>Clarkson&rsquo;s Portraiture of
Quakerism</i>.&nbsp; They have <a name="page1106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1106</span>no preaching among them, here
except when a stranger comes, as they have no public friend or
minister among themselves.&nbsp; They have three burying places
in this town, which may indicate that they have had here three
different meeting houses.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Presbyterian</span>
<i>Chapel</i>.&nbsp; Though the Presbyterians seem to be of
somewhat longer standing in this town than the Quakers, yet it
does not appear that they had here a separate place of worship as
early as they.&nbsp; They appeared here as a distinct sect soon
after the Restoration, in consequence of the ejection of <i>Mr.
Horne</i> from the vicarage of Lynn Allhallows, and from the
established priesthood.&nbsp; His acknowledged piety, learning,
and respectability of character, were likely to gain him
adherents as an ejected minister.&nbsp; The number of those who
adhered to him on that trying occasion we have not been able to
learn; but it is certain that they soon formed themselves into a
separate society, and report has said, that they met for some
time at a place fitted up for the purpose in a certain yard or
alley in Black-goose Street.&nbsp; They afterwards removed to
Spinner Lane, behind the house now inhabited by Mr.
<i>Dennis</i>, where they fitted up and converted into a decent
chapel, a round house, originally erected for a
Glass-house.&nbsp; Here the congregation assembled during the
whole ministration of the <i>two Rastricks</i>, and part of that
of <i>Mr. Mayhew</i>.&nbsp; After he had been here some time, the
old chapel falling into decay was given up, and the congregation
then removed to a new and neat chapel which they had erected in
Broad Street, which <a name="page1107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1107</span>was a more eligible
situation.&nbsp; Mr. Mayhew about the 70th year of his age
resigned the ministry, and was succeeded by <i>Mr. Warner</i>,
who was the minister of this chapel from 1777 to 1801, when he
resigned his charge and removed to <i>Hapton</i>.&nbsp; Before
his removal the congregation had been for sometime declining, not
for want of abilities in him, but rather for want of a larger
portion of sectarianism and proselytism.&nbsp; Several of the
principal members were removed by death, some before his
departure, and others soon after.&nbsp; Of the remainder, those
of them who might be expected to retain some attachment to the
cause, fearing the expense which might attend any exertion on
their part to revive and support it, now dastardly quitted their
post, and ingloriously sneaked back into the bosom of the
established church, and have ever since, as might be expected,
constituted some of its most useless members.&nbsp; In
consequence of that defection and desertion, the Calvinian
Methodists, under the name of Independents, thrust themselves in,
and got possession of the chapel, to which they could apparently
have no more right than the other Methodists, or even the
Quakers.&nbsp; Indeed it would seem that they had less right to
it than those, as the Lynn Presbyterians had always been
<i>Arminians</i> from the beginning.&nbsp; It was always said by
Mr. Warner, that the place, in the event of the extinction of the
Presbyterian interest here, according to the chapel deeds, would
become the property of the Presbyterian board, in London.&nbsp;
As to the Trustees, if they knew their business, they could not
suppose that they had any right transfer to another and hostile
denomination <a name="page1108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1108</span>the possession of the property with which they were
entrusted.&nbsp; This we notice as what we conceive to be due to
historical truth, and to the memory of the Presbyterian
congregation, which existed so usefully and reputably in this
town near 150 years, and whose ministers were in general among
the chief ornaments of the place for learning and respectability
of deportment.&mdash;The Presbyterian chapel was about 40 feet by
25, with a gallery fronting the pulpit.&nbsp; It has been since
lengthened to about 58 feet, with the addition of very narrow
side galleries.&nbsp; It is but ill planned, and supposed not
capable of containing so many people as either the Methodist or
Baptist chapels.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Baptist</span>
<i>Chapel</i>.&nbsp; This also is situated in <i>Broad
Street</i>, and not far from that of the Presbyterians.&nbsp; It
has been lately rebuilt, and is a neat handsome place, about 46
feet by 26, with deep galleries in the front and at both
ends.&nbsp; The dissenters of this denomination are not of so
long standing at Lynn as those treated of under the two last
articles.&nbsp; They were gathered and formed into a society here
in the reign of James II, by the ministry of the worthy and
memorable <i>Thomas Grantham</i>, who was indefatigable in his
endeavours to enlighten and reform his countrymen, and establish
them in what he deemed to be scriptural christianity.&nbsp; Till
a proper place of worship could be procured, it is understood
that he was allowed to preach in the Townhall; and he appears to
have been treated here with much respect, owing perhaps to his
respectable connections, the Granthams being then one of the
first <a name="page1109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1109</span>families in Lincolnshire.&nbsp; He was what is called
a <i>general</i> Baptist, and therefore not what was then, or
would be now, deemed orthodox.&nbsp; He never settled here, but
went mostly about, as an apostle or reformer, to promote what he
conceived to be the pure religion of the New Testament.&nbsp; He
succeeded in gathering and establishing many congregations in
different parts of the country, but chiefly in Lincolnshire and
Norfolk.&nbsp; The latter part of his time he resided mostly at
Norwich, where he gathered a congregation, in spite of the
intolerance and bitter enmity to dissenters, which continued to
rage there, even after the revolution: and there he died at the
beginning of 1692, at the age of 58. <a
name="citation1109"></a><a href="#footnote1109"
class="citation">[1109]</a>&nbsp; <a name="page1110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1110</span>About that time or a few months
earlier, the congregation at Lynn became the objects of
persecution from the ruling powers here.&nbsp; They were
proceeded against upon the <i>conventicle act</i>, although both
their place of worship and their minister had been regularly
licenced.&nbsp; An account of this dark and disgraceful business
has been given before at page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page861">861</a></span>.&nbsp; How long the congregation
was enabled to withstand this persecution we have not been able
to ascertain.&nbsp; Perhaps it was soon after borne down and
crushed.&nbsp; We are sure that it had become extinct long before
the denomination was again revived here about the commencement of
the present reign by the ministry of Mr. <i>Chesterton</i>.&nbsp;
The society then formed was <i>calvinistic</i>, and so more
orthodox than the former, and so it still continues.&nbsp; It was
dissolved about the time of Mr. Chesterton&rsquo;s death, but
again revived and reorganized about the year 1777; since which
time it has been kept up, though not always without some
difficulty.&nbsp; Their present minister is a person of good
report, and it is hoped he will be long comfortable and very
useful in his situation.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Methodist</span>
<i>Chapel</i>.&nbsp; This place, situated in the <i>North Clough
Lane</i>, is very well contrived and neatly fitted up.&nbsp; It
is about 42 feet by 30, with very deep galleries in front and at
both ends.&nbsp; It is so constructed as to be capable of
accommodating, perhaps, a greater <a name="page1111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1111</span>number of hearers than any of our
other chapels; yet such has been the late increase of Methodism
here, that it is now become too small for the audience; and
therefore for their better accommodation, a new and very
capacious, as well as elegant and splendid place is now about to
be erected in <i>Tower Street</i>, which is expected to be
completed by next Michaelmas.&nbsp; The expense of this intended
erection is estimated at 4000<i>l.</i> or more.&nbsp; As to the
old place, it is likely to be soon desecrated and converted to a
granary or warehouse, or place for some such secular and
unhallowed use: and though it would be a very commodious place of
worship for any other description of christians, yet it is
understood that it would not be obtainable for such a purpose,
from, as it would seem, the low and tradesman-like consideration,
that it would not be quite safe to have it occupied in the same
line, lest it should prove detrimental to the trade of the new
shop.&nbsp; The present writer remembers the Methodists a
persecuted sect, classed among the heretics of the day, and much
spoken against every where.&nbsp; They were then meek and
passive, and not apt to brand those of other denominations with
bad names, or fix upon them the odium of heresy.&nbsp; The case
is greatly altered since: they were then weak, but are now
powerful; they were then few, now they are numerous, and their
numbers daily and rapidly increasing.&nbsp; They consequently
assume a high tone, and join in the cry of <i>heresy</i> as
loudly as any of our persecuting sects&mdash;especially against
<i>anti-trinitarians</i>, or <i>unitarians</i>, and
<i>universalists</i>: and yet it is certain that the public mind,
<a name="page1112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1112</span>or
national opinion is no more inimical to persons of those
denominations at present, than it was to the Methodists fifty
years ago.&nbsp; Let the Methodists think of this, and learn a
becoming measure of moderation and good neighbourhood.&mdash;What
has happened to themselves may also happen, in a course of time,
to those whom they now so very bitterly and violently decry, and
so unmercifully stigmatize and anathematize.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Salem</span> <i>Chapel</i>.&nbsp;
This is a new place of worship, erected the latter pact of last
year, (1811,) in consequence of the dismission of <i>Mr.
Finch</i> from the pastoral office in the Baptist congregation,
on account of some difference of opinion about <i>satanic
influence</i>, and some other speculative and abstruse
points.&nbsp; The place is about 50 feet by 30; and so larger
than any of the other chapels here: and when galleries are
erected, (a measure already in contemplation,) it will be capable
of containing a larger audience than any of them.&nbsp; It is at
present well attended, and supposed likely to continue
so.&mdash;Mr. Finch&rsquo;s dismission from his late situation in
the Baptist chapel, <a name="citation1112"></a><a
href="#footnote1112" class="citation">[1112]</a> and especially
the manner in which it was transacted, being disapproved by many
of the hearers, who were much attached to his ministry, measures
were soon adopted to retain him still in the town, by erecting
for him a new chapel, where things should be conducted on a more
liberal plan, and in the true spirit of protestantism, to the
exclusion of all human creeds and formulas, and the admission of
the scripture <a name="page1113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1113</span>as the only religious directory, or sole rule of faith
and practice.&nbsp; In a society so formed, the essence of
christianity, it was <i>hoped</i>, would be exhibited as
consisting in the imitation of Jesus of Nazareth, a submission to
his authority, and reliance on him, arising from the firm
persuasion or belief of his Messiahship, or that he is indeed the
Christ, the Son of God&mdash;of which the New Testament affords
such clear and ample evidence.&nbsp; Whether or not that hope
will be realized, must be left for time to determine.&nbsp; The
persons chiefly concerned in this new undertaking are not anxious
to identify themselves with any one of our religious parties or
denominations, though they wish to maintain peace and good
neighbourhood with them all.&nbsp; If they ever connect or
identify themselves with any one party, it will probably be a
liberal, though small body of those called <i>general
Baptists</i>, <a name="citation1113"></a><a href="#footnote1113"
class="citation">[1113]</a> one of whose ministers, the worthy
and respectable author of the <i>Sketch of the Denominations of
the Christian World</i>, was unanimously invited to assist at the
opening of this new chapel, when his services gave entire and
abundant satisfaction.&nbsp; The first sermon he preached here,
being also the first that was delivered in this new place, has
been since published, with an <i>Appendix</i>, containing an
account of a late very curious correspondence between him and
<i>Mr. Berington</i>, a learned <i>Catholic priest</i>, which it
is supposed must render <a name="page1114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1114</span>this publication very
interesting.&nbsp; Except the stated minister, <i>Mr. Evans</i>
is the only one that has yet preached in this new chapel; but it
is understood that the occasional service of any worthy minister,
of whatever denomination, whether reputed orthodox or otherwise,
who passing this way may be disposed to address this
congregation, would not be here rejected.&nbsp; It may therefore
be expected that ministers of different views on many religious
subjects will be found sometimes officiating in this new pulpit;
which seems very well to accord with the avowed principles of
these people, who profess a readiness to hear what any serious
and pious religionist may have to say, and then to judge for
themselves of its reasonableness and accordance with the
scriptures.&nbsp; It is hoped they will carefully persevere in
this laudable course, trying all things, and holding fast that
which is good, however unfashionable such a mode of proceeding
may appear to have now become in the religious world.</p>
<p>Having now finished the account of places of worship, it may
not be improper to add here a few supplementary observations
before we close this section.&nbsp; First then it may be
remarked, that religion at Lynn exhibits the appearance of
considerable diversity; which diversity is allowed by the higher
powers, for which they are certainly not to be censured, as
religious liberty is one of the first and most undoubted rights
of man.&nbsp; Accordingly there are here Jews and Christians,
Catholics and Protestants, Churchmen and Dissenters, and the
latter of various orders and descriptions&mdash;all at present <a
name="page1115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1115</span>quite
unannoyed and undisturbed, <i>except what may be occasioned by
the bigotry and malevolence which some of them too often manifest
towards others of a different way of thinking</i>.&nbsp; This is
disgraceful enough to our sectarian bigots, and shews how little
they have yet learnt of Christ, and how ignorant they still are
of the spirit of his religion, notwithstanding their loud
pretensions to superior knowledge.</p>
<p>Each of the great bodies or sects, with which most of our
religious communities here are connected, has its particular
constitution, which is its law of confederation and great bond of
union, and may be said to be no less definable than our boasted
and admired English Constitution.&nbsp; All these sectarian
constitutions answer pretty well the end of their formation; but
do not all discover equal legislative capacity, or profoundness
of judgment in the different framers of them.&nbsp; Some of them
are such as can reflect but little credit on the skill or
judgment of their constructors, while others discover such
profound sagacity, deep penetration, and accurate knowledge of
mankind as would not have disgraced a Solon or a Lycurgus.&nbsp;
Of this latter sort is the constitution of those respectable
sectaries called <i>Friends</i> or <i>Quakers</i>, as appears
from <i>Barclay&rsquo;s Apology</i>, and <i>Clarkson&rsquo;s
Portraiture</i>.&nbsp; Of this sort too is <i>the constitution of
the Arminian or Wesleyan Methodists</i>, of which the fairest,
and fullest, and best account this writer has seen, or knows of,
is in <i>Nightingale&rsquo;s Portraiture of Methodism</i>; which
is a moderate size octavo volume, and well worth the perusal of
all who wish to <a name="page1116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1116</span>become more intimately acquainted with the history and
character of this rapidly increasing sect, which is said to be
likely soon to swallow up all the rest.&nbsp; However that may
happen, it seems very certain that Methodism, from the nature of
its constitution and organization, is calculated for a wide and
rapid increase, far beyond any otter existing sect now within the
British dominions.&nbsp; What may render this more credible to
the reader is, that there are now about 30 preachers of this
denomination, (including those called <i>local</i>) belonging to
this town and circuit, all in very constant employ here, or in
the surrounding villages; which seems a pretty fair specimen of
their present state throughout the realm.&nbsp; This is not
mentioned to disparage their exertions.&nbsp; If they think their
cause of superlative importance to mankind, let them persevere,
while they use no other, or worse means to insure success, than
pious persuasion and fair argument.&nbsp; If they succeed and
become the most numerous body of religionists in the country, let
them by all means be the <i>established church of
England</i>.&nbsp; Where would be the harm of that?&nbsp; We know
of none: at least, if they were to be constrained at the same
time to renounce and quit forever every remnant of a bigoted or
intolerant spirit towards their dissenting neighbours. <a

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Hints relating to the state of Deism</i>,
<i>Scepticism</i>, <i>Free-Masonry</i>, <i>&amp;c. in this
town</i>.</p>
<p>Considering the easy faith, or aversion to incredulity, which
our townsmen, in common with most of their dear countrymen, have
generally shewn, on almost all subjects and occasions, it may
seem rather odd that there should be found here any religious
unbelievers; and yet such is really the case.&nbsp; A very large
portion of the community, comprehending not a few persons of
reading and some reflection, appear to be at this time, either
unconvinced, or decided disbelievers of the divine authority and
truth of christianity.&nbsp; Nor is this perhaps much to be
wondered at, when the case is duly considered.&nbsp; To many, no
doubt, this unbelief, or infidelity, proves very
<i>convenient</i> and desirable, as it frees them from almost
every moral restraint, and leaves them much at liberty to follow
and gratify their vicious and lawless inclinations.&nbsp; Upon
this ground we may pretty safely account for the scepticism and
unbelief of <i>most</i> of our avowed infidels.&nbsp; These too,
seem to be the very worst of them, as they are more inexcusable
than that other sort, who viewing christianity through the medium
of its <i>corruptions</i>, hastily reject it altogether, as
utterly unworthy of their credit or acceptance.&nbsp; But it may
be said, &ldquo;they are very wrong, in determining so hastily,
without looking into the New Testament, and examining it as it is
delivered there.&rdquo;&nbsp; Very true.&nbsp; But who among our
numerous christian sects and parties, will dare, for shame, to
reproach them on that account, while they themselves, with all
their professed veneration for <a name="page1118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1118</span>that book, make no scruple to
deviate from it, whenever their interest or policy, or the
established formulas, creeds, or customs of their respective
parties require them so to do?&nbsp; One takes up <i>the
Athanasian Creed</i>, and says, &ldquo;this is christianity; and
except a man believe it he cannot be saved, but must, without
doubt, perish everlastingly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Can it be any wonder
that an honest and rational enquirer should startle, and say,
&ldquo;if this be christianity, I cannot believe its divine
authority, or that it came from God, for I am very sure that such
a self-contradictory farrago can never have proceeded from
him.&rdquo;&mdash;Other articles in great abundance, all equally
absurd and incredible, and very prominent in the creeds and
observances of the religions world, might be here added, and
which professing christians and christian ministers are daily
representing and recommending, as unquestionable parts of
christianity, and most worthy of our belief and reception.&nbsp;
In viewing christianity through the mists and fogs of its
numerous and enormous corruptions, it is certainly not very
wonderful that many who are not disposed to bestow much time upon
religious enquires should be discouraged, so as to stand aloof,
and deem the divine authority of it incredible&mdash;and if they
are very blameable for so doing, still no small portion of the
blame must be imputable to those who have so greatly tarnished
the beauties of christianity, and obscured its truth, by
presumptuously introducing, supporting, and advocating those
corruptions.</p>
<p>After all, the Deists are not to be deemed the worst enemies
of christianity.&nbsp; Its most dangerous foes are to <a
name="page1119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1119</span>be found
among its pretended friends and admirers, who would fain persuade
us that our public and national transactions are all, forsooth,
very christianlike and evangelical: and so by divesting
christianity of its morality, and reducing it to a mere state
engine, they do all they can to render it incredible and
contemptible in the eyes of all reflecting and honest
men.&mdash;Thus the American War, with all its
enormities&mdash;the African Slave trade, West Indian system,
Caribbean war of extermination, with all their horrors&mdash;the
late war, with all its follies&mdash;Pitt&rsquo;s reign of
terror, with all its espionage and profligacy&mdash;our days of
thanksgiving, fasting, and humiliation, with all their hypocrisy
and solemn mockery&mdash;the Copenhagen expedition&mdash;the
whole Irish system, and every public deviation from wisdom and
moral rectitude, have been represented by these men as very
justifiable, and thoroughly consistent with the dictates of
christianity.&nbsp; These people consist of courtiers and
statesmen, placemen and pensioners, laity and clergy, (even most
of our prelates and dignitaries,) and in short, the whole of that
immense multitude who live upon the public loaves and fishes, or
expect to come in for a share of them.&nbsp; That they should
profess the religion of the state, and be very clamorous too in
its defence, is natural enough&mdash;as well as that they should
be very ready to defend and justify all our public or state
measures; but it is not quite so clear that they are more
friendly or favourable to christianity, properly so called, than
our professed deists: on the contrary, by identifying their
monstrous corruptions with christianity, they may <a
name="page1120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1120</span>be said
to be its worst enemies; in comparison with whom, our professed
or avowed deists are feeble and harmless adversaries.&nbsp; The
deists of this town are said to be very numerous, and would, if
formed into a society, constitute, perhaps, the largest
congregation in the place: but they are not of a gregarious or
congregating character; <a name="citation1120a"></a><a
href="#footnote1120a" class="citation">[1120a]</a> and they know
in general so little of the New Testament, or uncorrupted
christianity, that their objections seldom affect any part of
it&mdash;their assault being chiefly directed against its
outworks, or rather its corruptions: and for every attempt to
expose and explore them they deserve every honest man&rsquo;s
thanks.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <i>Free Masons</i>.&nbsp; The origin of this numerous
sect or fraternity, as well as that of the <i>Gypsies</i>, is
involved in great and impenetrable obscurity.&nbsp; It is in vain
to look even to the most knowing of its own members for any
information upon that subject, that may in the least be depended
upon.&nbsp; Almost every thing they urge or allege about it is
evidently and ridiculously false and fabulous.&nbsp; They tell us
that the art and mystery of Masonry was first introduced at the
building of the <i>Tower of Babel</i>, and from thence handed
down by <i>Euclid</i>, who communicated it to <i>Hiram</i>, <a
name="citation1120b"></a><a href="#footnote1120b"
class="citation">[1120b]</a> the Master Mason <a
name="page1121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1121</span>concerned
in the building of <i>Solomon&rsquo;s Temple</i>; where was an
excellent and curious Mason that was chief under the grand Master
<i>Hiram</i> whose name was <i>Mannon Grecus</i>; who taught the
art of Masonry to <i>Carolus Marcel</i>, in France, who was
afterwards elected king of France; and from thence was brought to
England in the reign of king <i>Athelston</i>, who ordered an
assembly to be held once every year at York, which was the first
introduction of it to England. <a name="citation1121"></a><a
href="#footnote1121" class="citation">[1121]</a>&nbsp; At other
times they say, that masons first appeared in England A.D. 43,
when they built the monastery of <i>Glastonbury</i>.&nbsp; They
might as well have introduced them at the building of
<i>Stonehenge</i>, or at the commencement of <i>Druidism</i>, and
erection of the <i>druidical altars</i>.&nbsp; But it probably
slipt their memory.&nbsp; Others, indeed, though they seem not to
have belonged to the craft, have actually supposed them to have
sprung from the <i>druids</i>, who like them had a method of
making themselves known to one another by certain <i>secret
signs</i>; as is also said to have been the case with the
<i>Gnostics</i> and some other ancient heretical sects.&nbsp;
Others, however, carry the origin of the order still farther
back, even beyond the Flood, and name <i>Tubal-cain</i> as one of
the grandmasters of that period; in proof of which they refer to
a certain document, which they call, an <i>original
Record</i>.&mdash;Such wild and extravagant pretentions exhibit
<a name="page1122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1122</span>Free-Masonry in a very queer and unfavourable light:
and they ought never to have been countenanced by any of the
members who had any regard for their own characters.</p>
<p>Not only about their origin or extraction, but also in what
relates to their subsequent history, are the Free-Masons
chargeable with propagating the most idle fabrications.&nbsp;
Thus they tell us a most strange tale about the grand master
<i>Hiram</i>, called also <i>Hiram Abiff</i>; how <i>three</i>
out of the 15 <i>fellow crafts</i> conspired to assassinate him,
which they effected as he was coming out of the <i>Sanctum
Sanctorum</i>, where he had been praying.&nbsp; This was at noon
day.&nbsp; They hid the body, afterwards buried it, and then
absconded.&nbsp; These ruffians, whose names were <i>Jubela</i>,
<i>Jubelo</i>, and <i>Jubelum</i>, were afterwards discovered
near Joppa, by <i>three other fellow crafts</i>, who had gone in
pursuit of them.&nbsp; They were then brought before king
Solomon, by whose orders they were all three executed.&nbsp;
Hiram&rsquo;s body, being by the king&rsquo;s order dug out of
the grave where the three masonic ruffians had buried it, was
afterwards solemnly interred, forsooth, in the <i>Sanctum
Sanctorum</i>.&mdash;The tale is pretty long in some of the
masonic books; but this is the substance: and it is very
disgraceful to the fabricators and the propagators of it, as it
discovers a glaring propensity to the most sottish and profligate
kind of lying.&mdash;Much might be here added to the same
purpose; but this it is hoped will induce the members of this
community at Lynn, to review and reject this and every other
exceptionable part of their system.</p>
<p><a name="page1123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1123</span>As
to the mode of admission, parade about the cardinal points of the
compass, where the master and inferior functionaries are
stationed, and their forms about tyling the lodge, setting the
men to work, and calling them off to take refreshment, &amp;c.
&amp;c. they may be all harmless enough, or at least,
comparatively so: yet to the serious by-stander, or uninitiated,
they can hardly fail of appearing in no small degree frivolous
and childish.&mdash;Many indeed have deemed the whole system or
institution of masonry a designed burlesque upon scripture and
religion.&nbsp; But though there may be many circumstances that
would seem to bear that way, yet such is the unquestionable
respectability of many of its members that it is very certain
such a design could never have met with their concurrence or
countenance.&nbsp; The fact, that such characters do really
belong to this community seems also to prove that there must be
some good points pertaining to masonry, which recommend it to
their approbation, and hide in a great measure, or at least
appear to counterbalance the defects above mentioned.&nbsp; In
particular, it is said, that those of this fraternity, not only
are much given to conviviality and good fellowship, but also
abound in acts of kindness and charity, especially among
themselves, and towards their brethren in distress; and even that
they are generally among the most active promoters of benevolent
deeds, or good works in the places where they reside.&nbsp; If it
be really so, it will account for that warm attachment to masonry
which many well disposed and respectable persons have often
manifested.&nbsp; In short, when we consider the fair and
estimable characters of many of our masons, the <a
name="page1124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1124</span>order
appears respectable: but, on the other hand, when we advert to
the forged and absurd tales, and to those idle forms, customs,
and ceremonies that are attached to the institution, we cannot
help wondering how those worthy members can patiently or possibly
endure them, or quietly continue in the connection.&nbsp; But
they conceive, no doubt, that the good preponderates, or that the
excellencies of masonry outweigh its defects, and satisfy their
minds with that consideration.&nbsp; Be it so, it is not meant
here to judge or blame them for so doing: they have certainly a
very good right to think and act for themselves, so long as no
one is thereby wronged or injured.</p>
<p>The present form and organization of the masonic sect appear
to be but of very recent origin, and cannot perhaps be traced
beyond the era of the revolution.&nbsp; The fraternity soon after
began to assume something like its present appearance; and as it
consisted mostly of rather suspicious characters, it was for a
long while deemed a tory or jacobitical institution.&nbsp; It did
not spread very much before the accession of the Brunswick
family; after which it multiplied apace, but was still thought to
consist, chiefly at least, of disaffected persons and friends of
the pretender.&nbsp; In process of time, however, that reproach
was completely done away, when it came to be known that not only
courtiers, but even some branches of the reigning family were
among its members.</p>
<p>The first regular lodge in this town was opened at the White
Lion Inn, October 1. 1729.&nbsp; Since which time <a
name="page1125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1125</span>there is
supposed to have always existed here one or more regular
lodges.&nbsp; There are now here three lodges.&nbsp; Two of them
deem themselves to all intents and purposes regular and orthodox,
but are not willing to allow the third to be so.&nbsp; What is
the real ground of this difference, or what it is that
constitutes masonic regularity or irregularity, orthodoxy or
heterodoxy, is beyond the competency of the present writer to
pronounce or explain.&nbsp; He has been informed by some of the
Lynn masons, that the whole number of them now in this town,
(exclusive, as he understood, of those of the irregular lodge)
amount to above five hundred: from which it would seem that
masonry is here at this time in a thriving and flourishing
condition.&nbsp; As to their great and boasted secret, we shall
not presume to guess what it may be, but shall most willingly let
it quietly remain among the mysteries, without the least
solicitude or wish for its discovery.&nbsp; Nor will we so much
as mention the heavy charge which professor <i>Robison</i> and
the <i>Frenchman</i> brought some years ago against the whole
order; believing as we do that it was totally unfounded.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <i>Society of True Britons</i>.&nbsp; This
institution did not last long.&nbsp; It seemed not to have any
very important object in view.&nbsp; The dignified name it
assumed, with the pompous formalities of its organisation, could
not therefore insure its permanence.&nbsp; It was established
with no small parade, with <i>Governor</i>, <i>Deputy
governor</i>, <i>Secretary</i>, <i>Sword-bearer</i>, &amp;c.
together with <i>laws</i> and a <i>constitution</i>, which all
the members were solemnly to <i>swear</i> to observe, and keep
inviolate.&nbsp; The first meetings <a name="page1126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1126</span>of this memorable Society were held
in the autumn of 1749; after which they were conducted for
sometime in great form: but their proceedings appeared in general
very much like a burlesque upon all corporate bodies and social
institutions.&nbsp; This might be very easily exemplified, but it
would probably afford the reader but little gratification, as we
cannot find that the society proved of any material benefit to
church or state; or to the town itself&mdash;some of whose
leading families, however, such as its <i>Bagges</i> and
<i>Brownes</i>, were among its members. <a
name="citation1126"></a><a href="#footnote1126"
class="citation">[1126]</a>&nbsp; But we will here dismiss the
subject and close this section.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Brief account of the Almshouses of
Lynn</i>; <i>and also of its Purse-clubs or Benefit
Societies</i>.</p>
<p>Of St. Mary Magdalen&rsquo;s Hospital, or the <i>Gaywood
Almshouse</i>, which stands a little way out of the town, a
pretty long and circumstantial account has been already given, in
another part of the work. (see p. 530, &amp;c.)&mdash;Exclusive
of that, there are here three almshouses, which are all within
the town, but of more recent origin than the former.&nbsp; Of
these three, by much the most ancient is the <i>Bede-house</i>,
or old women&rsquo;s almshouse, over against the New
Burying-ground.&nbsp; Near to this, and seemingly about the spot
now occupied by <i>Mr. Bonnett&rsquo;s school</i> and dwelling,
stood formerly an almshouse for <i>old men</i>; which being the
<i>southmost</i> of the two, was probably the reason why the
other, according to some old writings, went by the name of the
<i>North-house</i>.&nbsp; These almshouses appear to have been
founded in the 14th century, by some of the original members of
one of our ancient Gilds, that of <i>St. Giles</i> and <i>St.
Julian</i>.&nbsp; It <a name="page1128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1128</span>is not quite clear that they owed
their origin to that gild itself, but rather to some of its most
charitable and opulent members; such as <i>Edm. Bellyter</i>,
(<i>or Bellyete</i>,) merchant; <i>Tho. Constantyn</i>,
<i>Esq</i>; and <i>Margaret</i>, his daughter; and <i>Wm.
Inot</i>, merchant.&nbsp; The gild was constituted in 1384, but
the date of the erection of these almshouses, is involved in
considerable obscurity, so that it seems uncertain whether it
occurred previously or subsequently to that year.</p>
<p>But whenever they were erected, and whether by the persons
above mentioned, exclusively, or by the gild at large, it is
pretty evident that they became in no long time the property of
that gild; and there is reason to believe that they continued so
till the dissolution of the Monasteries, when all the gilds
shared the same fate.&nbsp; At that time the property of this
gild, as well as that of others still more opulent, fell probably
into the hands of the corporation.&nbsp; For some reason, the
<i>men&rsquo;s</i> almshouse was dissolved, but that of the
<i>women</i>, or <i>Bedehouse</i>, as it was then, and is still
called, was continued, under the patronage of that body.&nbsp; It
does not clearly appear how many persons were originally
maintained in these <i>two</i> houses.&nbsp; But we learn that
the <i>men&rsquo;s</i> house had in it <i>seven</i> chambers, and
the <i>women&rsquo;s six</i>.&nbsp; Supposing therefore that but
<i>one</i> person occupied each chamber, the number between both
houses would be <i>thirteen</i>; but if we suppose that
<i>two</i> were placed in each chamber, (as might be the case in
those times; and more than two cannot be supposed;) then the
whole number would <a name="page1129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1129</span>be <i>twenty-six</i>.&nbsp; The
question, however, is now immaterial, and requires no further
attention. <a name="citation1129"></a><a href="#footnote1129"
class="citation">[1129]</a></p>
<p>When the Bedehouse came into the hands of the corporation, it
seems they divided each of the chambers into two, so as to make
<i>twelve</i>, instead of <i>six</i>, as we find is still the
case.&nbsp; This probably accounts for one half of them being
without a fireplace, which is not likely to have been the case
originally: and it has certainly been very inconvenient ever
since to those who have occupied those chambers.&nbsp; It is
therefore to be hoped, that when Mr. <i>Cook&rsquo;s</i> legacy
is obtained, this inconvenience will be soon remedied.&nbsp; The
number of occupants now, as well as for a long time past, is
<i>twelve</i>: <i>eleven women</i>, and the <i>reader</i>; who is
a sort of <i>chaplain</i>, reading prayers and guiding the
devotion of the sisterhood, mornings and evenings.</p>
<p>Till the last summer, (1811,) this house had been for some
years in a very low state, and might be denominated the mansion
of starvation, rather than the habitation of mercy and charity,
or house of bread.&nbsp; The weekly allowance to each poor woman
was only <i>thirty pence</i> and <i>three farthings</i>!&mdash;a
sad proof of the very low ebb to which the generosity and
humanity of the patrons of the place had been reduced!&nbsp; At
length however they awoke to a sense of the unseemliness of this
mock charity, and very commendably added <i>another thirty
pence</i> to the weekly allowance of each inmate, or
pensioner.&nbsp; <a name="page1130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1130</span>This addition has materially benefitted them, and
ameliorated their condition, and the present writer wishes he had
it in his power to name the individual from whom it originated,
who certainly has deserved well, not only of the poor pensioners
themselves, but also of the community at large.</p>
<p>Soon after this fortunate augmentation of the allowance or
income of those poor pensioners, intelligence arrived of a still
further provision being made for them, by a gentleman lately
deceased, of the name of <i>Cook</i>, <a
name="citation1130a"></a><a href="#footnote1130a"
class="citation">[1130a]</a> who lived in London, and left them
by his will 2000<i>l.</i> in the 3 per cents; the interest
whereof to be applied in augmentation of their weekly
income.&nbsp; This charitable bequest, which is likely soon to be
transferred into the hands of the corporation, as the trustees or
guardians of these poor pensioners, will add it is to be hoped,
another <i>half crown</i> to their weekly allowance; which will
render their situation very comfortable, compared with what it
has been of late years.&nbsp; To have each chamber destitute of a
fireplace furnished with that needful appendage, <a
name="citation1130b"></a><a href="#footnote1130b"
class="citation">[1130b]</a> would be to most of them a still
further and very desirable accommodation.</p>
<p><a name="page1131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1131</span>By
an old MS. volume which has very lately fallen into the hands of
this writer, he learns that one John <i>Loneyson</i>, or
<i>Leneyston</i>, <a name="citation1131a"></a><a
href="#footnote1131a" class="citation">[1131a]</a> by will
bearing date in 1594, endowed this almshouse, and gave it an
annuity of 10<i>l.</i> from 75, (or 76) acres of pasture, called
<i>out marshes</i>, or <i>salt marshes</i>, lying and being in
South Lyn, anciently purchased of <i>Charles Cornwallis</i> and

corporation in the 2nd. year of James I. <a

contradicts the <i>Tablet</i> in the church, which made such stir
among our townsmen last year, may deserve some consideration from
the member of the Hall.</p>
<p>Beside the above endowment in land there was a sum of money
amounting 600<i>l.</i> left by divers persons to this almshouse,
the interest whereof to be applied to the support or maintenance
of the pensioners: and as money bore then a higher interest than
at present, the annual product of this provision amounted to no
trifling sum.&nbsp; This money was placed in the hands of the
corporation; 400<i>l.</i> of it laid out at interest, and
200<i>l.</i> employed in buying or trafficking in <i>rye</i>;
whence it was sometimes called <i>rye money</i>.&nbsp; In short
the 600<i>l.</i> and the 10<i>l.</i> a year <a
name="page1132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1132</span>before
mentioned seem to have constituted formerly the chief of the
funds of this almshouse: only in extraordinary cases, such as
sickness, the pensioners were relieved by voluntary
contributions. <a name="citation1132a"></a><a
href="#footnote1132a" class="citation">[1132a]</a>&nbsp; It
should be here further noted that it appears from the said MS.
that in consideration of the above funds, the corporation
formerly paid yearly in money to this almshouse 44<i>l.</i> and
moreover 8<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> by 9 chaldron of <i>coals</i> and
200 <i>sedge</i>&mdash;making in all 52<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i>
which, including the afore-mentioned extraordinary charges, is
said to <i>surmount the interest of the whole money given</i>;
which might well be supposed to have been the case. <a

1133</span>2.&nbsp; <i>Finkel-Row Almshouse</i>, or
<i>Valenger&rsquo;s Hospital</i>, in South Lynn.&nbsp; This house
was founded in 1605. by <i>Thomas Valenger</i>, gent. then
Town-Clerk of Lynn, for <i>four poor men</i> to dwell in
gratis.&nbsp; We cannot learn that he endowed it with any land or
money, though it is said that some land does now belong to it, an
advance in the rent of which, two years ago, occasioned an
addition of 3<i>d.</i> a week to be made to the allowance of each
pensioner.&nbsp; Last year there was a more considerable
addition, of no less than <i>one shilling</i> a week, made to
that allowance; making it in the whole 4<i>s.</i> a week, which
is the amount of the present weekly allowance of each of them:
and this sum is paid them weekly by the overseers of the
parish.&nbsp; As <i>Mr. Cook</i>, mentioned under the preceding
article, has left 700<i>l.</i> in the 3 per cents to this
charity, each pensioner, it is supposed, may shortly expect a
further addition of 2<i>s.</i> a week or more to their present
allowance.&nbsp; Like the Gaywood hospital, this house was
originally designed for <i>men</i>; but it has been now for a
good many years converted to the use of the other sex, and has
been ever since occupied by <i>four</i> poor <i>women</i>, who
have in it now very comfortable dwellings, the house having been
rebuilt in 1806.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <i>Paradise Hospital</i>, or <i>Broad Street
Almshouse</i>.&nbsp; This house appears to have been founded in
1676, by <a name="page1134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1134</span>one <i>John Heathcote</i>, <i>otherwise Helcote</i>,
of whom some mention has been already made, at page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page827">827</a></span>.&nbsp; He
dying while the work was unfinished, the completion of it was
undertaken and effected the year following by the famous <i>Henry
Framingham</i>.&nbsp; Of him also some mention is made in the
page last referred to, as well as in page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page861">861</a></span>.&nbsp; It
is probable that the former died intestate, without having made
any provision for the endowment of the almshouse, and that his
heirs were not disposed to complete the plan which he had
formed.&nbsp; However that was, Framingham appears to have then
stept forward and purchased the premises, for the laudable
purpose of completing the benevolent institution which the other
had projected.&nbsp; This house is pleasantly situated, in the
field called Paradise, on the east side of Broad Street, with
which it communicates, and from which is its only entrance.&nbsp;
It consists of a chapel and twelve apartments or dwellings, all
opening into a quadrangular court, to which there is an entrance
by a gateway from the street.&nbsp; Those dwellings are occupied
by 12 poor men, one of whom officiates as chaplain, and is called
<i>The Reader</i>; in consideration of which he has an additional
pension or allowance.&nbsp; Attached to those 12 apartments are
as many little gardens, which lie on each side of the entrance
from the street.&nbsp; Framingham, it seems, endowed only 11 of
these dwellings: the other endowed a long while after, by one of
our alderman, whose was <i>John Goodwyn</i>.&nbsp; The present
weekly allowance of each of these 12 pensioners is 3<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i> with the addition of 15<i>d.</i> to the chaplain,
which makes his weekly allowance 4<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>&nbsp; The
11 lay brethren have each a chaldren of <a
name="page1135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1135</span>coals
yearly, and the chaplain a chaldron and half.&nbsp; They have
beside, the interest of 250<i>l.</i> which they receive half
yearly.&nbsp; This it is presumed is a pretty correct account of
the present state of these pensioners; but it must not here pass
unnoticed, that Mr. <i>Cook</i>, the charitable benefactor of the
other almshouses, and whose memory ought to be very dear to all
our pensioners, has left to this house the sum of 2000<i>l.</i> 3
per cent stock, for the augmentation of the weekly allowance of
the 12 poor occupants: when this bequest therefore is obtained,
which is now very soon expected, it can not fail of considerably
bettering their condition.&nbsp; But what an indelible disgrace
is the benefaction of Mr. Cook to the memories of all those
overgrown wealthy Lynn men, who have departed this life without
the least apparent spark of benevolence, or one charitable
thought towards their indigent neighbours.</p>
<p>Besides its <i>four</i> Almshouses, (including that of
Gaywood,) Lynn is also distinguished for divers other charitable
institutions, and particularly for a great number of those called
<i>benefit societies</i>, or <i>purse clubs</i>, which amount to
<i>upwards of twenty</i>.&nbsp; Most of them consist of
<i>men</i>, but some few are made up of the other sex; <a
name="citation1135"></a><a href="#footnote1135"
class="citation">[1135]</a> <a name="page1136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1136</span>which in most places we believe is
rather an unusual case, as it has been generally supposed that
such societies would not succeed.&nbsp; Here, however, they are
said to have succeeded, and to have proved very beneficial.&nbsp;
Their plans and constitutions seem well formed, and their rules
and orders have been circulated in print.&nbsp; These societies,
as might be supposed, hold their meetings in private houses,
those, probably, of some of their most opulent and active
patronesses.&nbsp; Of the societies of this description which
consist wholly of <i>men</i>, some are of a superior order, and
designed particularly for the benefit of females or
<i>widows</i>.&nbsp; One of those, if we are not mistaken, is
called, &ldquo;The Provident Society for the benefit of
widows;&rdquo; and another, &ldquo;The Benevolent Viduarian
Society.&rdquo;&nbsp; The latter was established Nov. 5.1807. and
the former several years earlier.&nbsp; Both of them, if we are
rightly informed, secure to each widow an annuity of twenty
pounds, which to most cannot fail of being a very desirable
object.</p>
<p>The meetings of these two societies, and of all the rest that
belong to the <i>men</i>, are kept at different public houses in
various parts of the town: <a name="citation1136"></a><a
href="#footnote1136" class="citation">[1136]</a> and it is
probable <a name="page1137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1137</span>that they are the most suitable places, upon the
whole, that could be easily obtained for that purpose.&nbsp; It
may be here further observed, that we scarce ever hear of any
thing in the conduct of those who attend at these meetings, that
is palpably improper, unbecoming, or exceptionable.&nbsp; So that
the rules and orders of these fraternities appear to have taught
the members in general to pay a due respect to a propriety or
decency of behaviour, so as to fit them to be better members of
the community.&nbsp; This consideration not a little enhances the
use and importance of these friendly and fraternal institutions,
as manifestly conducing to the cultivation of good manners,
civilization, and moral improvement.</p>
<p>But in an account of our Benefit-Societies, and provident,
benevolent, or charitable institutions, the two following
charities ought not to be forgotten&mdash;1. The <i>Lying-in
Charity</i>.&nbsp; This was set on foot in 1791, by the late Mrs.
Elizabeth Gibbons, in conjunction with Mrs. Keed, Mrs. S. Newham,
&amp;c. for <i>lending Child-bed Linen </i><a
name="page1138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1138</span><i>to
poor women</i>: and it is said to have been the means of
affording great relief to those who were the objects of it.&nbsp;
It has been assisted and supported by subscriptions from several
Ladies, amounting for the last year to 37<i>l.</i>
6<i>s.</i>&mdash;As it is known to have proved very beneficial,
it is to be hoped that it will be long continued.&mdash;2. The
<i>Stranger&rsquo;s friend Society</i>. <a
name="citation1138"></a><a href="#footnote1138"
class="citation">[1138]</a>&nbsp; This has been set on foot here
by the <i>Methodists</i>, but has been supported by many others
of the inhabitants, and rendered very useful to the
poor.&mdash;An account of the state and proceedings of this
society is published annually: about which time a sermon is also
preached at the Methodist Chapel, for the benefit of the
institution.&nbsp; Those who are appointed by the society for the
office of <i>visiting</i> the distressed poor, are directed to
assist them by prayer and religious instruction, as well as by
their alms.</p>
<p>&#9758; Before he entirely closes this section, the author
feels it incumbent upon him to confess, that since the last sheet
was printed off, he has, upon further consideration, become less
confident of the annuity mentioned at p. <span

originally left to the <i>Bedehouse</i>.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Brief account of the</i> Schools, <i>with
some hints on the present state of Education at Lynn</i>.</p>
<p>Before the Reformation, the education (such as it was) of the
children and youth of this country was committed chiefly to the
monks and friars; and carried on in the convents and religious
houses,&mdash;of which description were even the very
universities themselves, if indeed they are not so still.&nbsp;
Lynn had then many of those convents and religious houses; and it
seems probable that each of them had in it a school, of some sort
or other.&nbsp; But they were all schools for <i>boys</i>; and
yet but few, compared with the whole number of the Lynn boys of
those times, can be supposed to have been so fortunate as to get
there admitted.&nbsp; As to the <i>girls</i>, there was then no
such provision made for their education: and they seem to have
been, in that point of view, as little regarded as if our
ancestors thought, like the Mahometans, that women had no
souls.</p>
<p>Among the inconveniences occasioned by the general dissolution
of the monasteries, one of them must have been that of being
deprived of those conventual schools.&nbsp; How long the town
continued without any substitutes for them, we are not able to
say.&nbsp; Something probably might be done in the reign of
<i>Edward</i>, though we have not been able to discover any clear
proof of it: only the fact may be supposed, as it is well known
that many schools were established in that reign, and endowed
with some small fragments of the abbey-revenues.&nbsp; Indeed
there is some reason to conclude that there was a school, on a
very small scale, established here by the corporation, <a
name="page1140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1140</span>almost
immediately after the dissolution, as appears from the following
passage in an old memorandum book, extracted chiefly, as it would
seem, from the Hall-records&mdash;&ldquo;1538, Sept; 29. Thomas
Person, prest, late ffryer, was chosen to be Charnell Prest: He
to have for his selary viii<i>l.</i> iiii<i>s.</i> and licence to
preche iiii tymes every Quarter, <i>and frely to teche vi
Child.[ren.]</i>&rdquo;&mdash;The last expression necessarily
implies the establishment of a <i>school</i> for the education of
<i>six children</i>: and as the teacher was the charnel priest,
it may reasonably be concluded that the school was kept at, or
over the charnel house.&nbsp; That also being the place where our
Grammar School was kept till the erection of the present
building, it seems not improbable that this little school for the
education of half a dozen boys may have been the origin of that
seminary.&nbsp; How long our means of education were confined to
one solitary establishment for six boys, we are not able now to
say; but we could discover no appearance of the existence of any
thing further till <i>above forty years</i> after the dissolution
of the convents, when a respectable seminary, on an extensive
scale, began to give additional dignity to the character of the
town.&mdash;We will now proceed to give a cursory view of our
principal schools, and present state of education.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>The Grammar School</i>.&nbsp; This has long borne
a respectable character among the grammar-schools of this
country.&nbsp; It is supposed to have been established about the
middle of the reign of Elizabeth, as we have been able to trace
it no further back than the year 1580, when we find it an
established school, and its <i>master&rsquo;s</i> name
<i>Iverye</i>. <a name="citation1140"></a><a href="#footnote1140"
class="citation">[1140]</a>&nbsp; He died in 1590, <a
name="page1141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1141</span>and was
succeeded by <i>Alex. Roberts M.A.</i> who had a stipend of 20
marks a year, and the house where his predecessor lived.&nbsp; He
becoming one of the ministers of the town, was succeeded in 1593
by <i>Nic. Eston M.A.</i> of Pemb. Hall, Cambridge.&nbsp; Eston
in 1597, was succeeded by <i>John Man</i> M.A. who in 1608, was
succeeded by <i>Hen. Allston</i>, on condition that he
<i>considered himself as holding the school only during the
goodwill and pleasure of the Mayor</i>, <i>A. and C. C.</i>&nbsp;
He appears not to have been on the best terms with the
corporation; and about 1613, was succeeded by a <i>Mr.
Armitage</i>.&nbsp; He dying in 1618, was succeeded by <i>Mr.
Robt. Robinson</i>.&nbsp; He died in 1626, and was succeeded by
<i>Ambr. Fish</i>, who shortly after gave up his charge, and was
succeeded, 11. May 1627, by <i>Robt. Woodmansea M.A.</i> of
Loughborough.&nbsp; He removing in the spring of 1634 (or rather
1635,) had for his successor <i>John Rawlinson M.A.</i> of St.
John&rsquo;s Col. Cambridge, <a name="page1142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1142</span>who removed, as it seems, in 1637,
and was then succeeded by <i>Edw. Bell M.A.</i> who, if we are
not mistaken, held the place 40 years; and dying in 1678 was
succeeded by the memorable <i>John Horne M.A.</i> who held the
mastership of this seminary still longer; even no less than 51 or
52 years, with much credit to himself and no small advantage to
his numerous pupils.&nbsp; He was succeeded May 21. 1730. by
<i>Charles Squire</i>; who was succeeded by &mdash; <i>Pigge</i>;
and he by <i>John Danville</i>, and he by <i>John Knox</i>, who
resigned in 1760, <a name="citation1142a"></a><a
href="#footnote1142a" class="citation">[1142a]</a> when he was
succeeded by <i>Dr. David Lloyd</i>, who continued at the head of
this seminary 34 years, and supported during all that time a
character no way inferior, perhaps, to the most eminent of his
predecessors.&nbsp; He was succeeded in 1794 by his eldest son
<i>Henry Lloyd D.D.</i> the present Hebrew Professor at
Cambridge.&nbsp; Upon his resignation in 1797, he was succeeded
by <i>Richard Scott</i>, who in 1803 was succeeded by the present
master, the rev. <i>Martin Coulcher</i>. <a
name="citation1142b"></a><a href="#footnote1142b"
class="citation">[1142b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page1143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1143</span>The
course of education in this seminary, is similar to what is usual
in most of our endowed grammar-schools, or free-schools.&nbsp;
Its original object seems to have been to teach the rudiments of
the learned languages, which still forms a principal part of the
plan; but like the generality of our modern numerous and
respectable boarding schools, it has now for many years embraced
divers other objects, and even all those branches of education,
the knowledge of which is now deemed necessary to fit our youth
to become men of business, and useful and accomplished members of
society.&nbsp; The endowment to this seminary is about
60<i>l.</i> a year, and a handsome dwelling-house for the master;
for which he is to teach a certain number of freemen&rsquo;s
children gratis: but it is only in grammar or classical learning;
for which reason they are but few in number; and he depends
chiefly for his support upon those pupils he derives from other
quarters.&nbsp; In some cases those who go from this seminary to
the university, are entitled to certain exhibitions or pecuniary
aids, which some well disposed persons deceased have bequeathed
for the benefit of such young scholars.</p>
<p>Our other <i>boy</i>-schools are now pretty numerous, and are
entitled to different degrees of estimation, from those of
Messrs. Coulton, Smith, and Bonnet, down to those of our veriest
or humblest abecedarian pedagogues, who yet are doubtless very
useful in their sphere.&mdash;Of <i>girl</i>-schools there are
here likewise a great many, and they also are of different sorts,
and descend, like the <a name="page1144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1144</span>former, in various gradations, from
the respected boarding schools of Miss Nichols and Miss
Henderson, to the liliputian seminaries of those homely dames
whose pupils are made up of young misses and masters of two,
three, and four years old.&nbsp; The two schools here first
mentioned, (those of Miss N. and Miss H.) are very respectable;
and the former has been so for a great many years, and still
maintains its character with undiminished reputation.&nbsp; But
as these good ladies can be in no want of any encomium or praises
which are in the power of this writer to bestow, he will here
drop the subject.</p>
<p>We must not however close our account of the Lynn schools,
without noticing those which are formed on the Lancasterian plan;
of which there are two here established&mdash;one for <i>boys</i>
and the other for <i>girls</i>.&nbsp; Of the latter the following
sketch, it is presumed, will be found pretty correct.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>The Charity School for Girls</i> was
founded by voluntary subscription, at a meeting of ladies held at
the Town-hall, April 13. 1792, and opened May 28 following.&nbsp;
It provided instruction, in reading, sewing, and spinning, with
some portion of clothing, for 30 children.&nbsp; A room in
Purfleet street was for some years hired for the purpose; but in
1805 a much more suitable apartment, adjoining to the north tower
of St. Margaret&rsquo;s Church, was fitted up by the subscribers:
and the school has been since extended to 50 girls, under the
direction of <i>Miss Harriet Howell</i>, who has successfully
adapted the new or Lancasterian method of education to the
instruction of girls&mdash;This school is now supported <a
name="page1145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1145</span>in a
great measure by taking in plain work; as the whole amount of the
subscription, for the current year is only 49<i>l.</i>
7<i>s.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other charitable seminary, that for <i>boys</i>, and which
in fact is our proper Lancasterian school, is of much later
origin than the preceding.&nbsp; Of its rise and progress the
following brief account, we doubt not, will be found pretty
accurate&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is remarkable that in so large a town as
this, there was no public charity school for boys prior to the
year 1808.&nbsp; Complaints were loud and universal of the number
of idle and disorderly boys, who were rioting in our streets, and
sometimes committing great depredations upon the property of
individuals.&nbsp; But the very magnitude of the evil seemed to
discourage all endeavours to remove it.&nbsp; The expense of
educating so large a number upon the old plan of instruction,
which required one master to every 30 or 40 boys, precluded all
hope of raising an adequate contribution from the public; and no
effect could not be expected from a private person commensurate
to the existing evil, of so large a portion of the population
being destitute of all moral or religious instruction.&nbsp; But
the rise of the new system of education, by which one master can
teach almost any number of boys that one room can hold, soon
attracted the attention of those who felt for the rising
generation: and as this improved system was then practised only
by Mr. Joseph Lancaster, in London, an application was made to
him for a master.&nbsp; Upon which he kindly offered to come
down, and gave a public lecture at the assembly room upon the
subject, <a name="page1146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1146</span>February 8. 1808.&nbsp; Several resolutions for the
establishment of a school in this place, by his assistance, were
immediately agreed upon; a committee of 15 subscribers for the
management of the institution, were afterwards nominated; the
Corporation granted the use of a building well adapted for the
purpose, and on Wednesday, May 11. in the same year, the school
was opened for 230 boys. <a name="citation1146a"></a><a
href="#footnote1146a" class="citation">[1146a]</a>&mdash;The
success and the utility of this institution have fully answered
every reasonable expectation which could be formed respecting
it.&mdash;The annual subscriptions for the present year amount to
111<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Besides these schools, which are under the direction of the
clergymen of the establishment, there are here two sunday schools
under the direction of the dissenters.&nbsp; The chief of these,
and of the longest standing, is under the care of the revd. <i>I.
Allen</i>, and kept at his meeting house, in Broad Street; but it
is supported by the subscriptions of persons of different
denominations, churchmen as well as dissenters. <a
name="citation1146b"></a><a href="#footnote1146b"
class="citation">[1146b]</a>&nbsp; It has existed some years, and
is deemed a very useful institution.&nbsp; The other is of more
recent origin, and at present on a much smaller scale, and is
kept at the Baptist meeting house.&nbsp; It is only for boys;
whereas Mr. Allen&rsquo;s is for both boys and girls, but chiefly
the latter.&nbsp; In his last annual account, if we are not
mistaken, Mr. A. has represented both these schools as only one
school, making the whole number of scholars 249&mdash;143 girls,
and 109 boys.&nbsp; Of <a name="page1147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1147</span>the latter about 60, as we are
told, belong to the <i>Baptist</i> Sunday School.&nbsp; These
institutions, it is to be hoped, will long prove very useful to
the town.&mdash;But we must not omit here to mention that the
Lynn Sunday Schools originated with the <i>Methodists</i> about
25 years ago.&nbsp; The school which they then established was
carried on with much spirit, and to very good purpose for several
years; but was at last given up in favour of an extensive
day-school, which was then planned, and which it was supposed
would render the other unnecessary.&nbsp; But either that
day-school was not established, or it did not succeed; so that
the Methodists were too hasty in discontinuing their school,
which if we rightly recollect, consisted of about 200 children.
<a name="citation1147"></a><a href="#footnote1147"
class="citation">[1147]</a></p>
<p>From the foregoing account the reader may form some idea of
the present state of education in this town.&nbsp; The
Lancasterian schools have answered the most sanguine expectations
of their patrons and promoters, and especially the boy-school,
which has hitherto given abundant satisfaction, and has greatly
conduced to the credit both of the managers and the
teacher.&nbsp; The dispute which has agitated other parts of the
kingdom as to the respective merits of Bell and Lancaster, will,
it is to be hoped, not materially affect this town.&nbsp; For
though the Church Catechism is taught here, which the present
writer thinks in part very absurd; yet if the young pupils think
at all as they grow up, and advert to the new <a
name="page1148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1148</span>testament, that absurdity will not long have any very
strong hold upon their minds, or remain a great while
unperceived.&nbsp; As they will be enabled to read the
scriptures, if they will take the trouble of searching them, and
judge for themselves, they may be soon very capable to determine
how far the Church Catechism and the Common prayer book are to be
deemed necessary appendages to the inspired writings.</p>
<p>As to our schools of the better sort, or of the higher order,
we judge that they are as well conducted as those of the like
description in most other places.&nbsp; Some indeed have found
fault, especially with those for female education, for what may
be called too much uniformity, or not varying more the course of
instruction, and adapting it to the ranks, circumstances, or
prospects of the respective pupils.&nbsp; Hence the
tradesman&rsquo;s and petty farmer&rsquo;s daughters are taught
music, drawing, and other genteel accomplishments, in common with
those of the squire, the merchant, and opulent farmer, who are
expected and designed to move in a much higher sphere.&nbsp; In
giving the former the education of fine ladies they are supposed
to be unfitted for that station in life in which they are likely
to be placed, by having their minds filled with such high notions
as can but very ill accord with their probable future
destiny.&nbsp; This therefore has been deemed contrary to the
dictates of reason, and every just rule of prudence and
propriety.&nbsp; But however absurd this may be, the blame seems
not imputable to the governesses of these seminaries, but rather
to the parents or guardians of those pupils.&nbsp; Nor would it
be very safe <a name="page1149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1149</span>perhaps for our governesses to remonstrate with these,
or even so much as hint on the absurdity or impropriety of such
an indiscriminate and preposterous course of instruction, as it
would be taken as a reflection on their superior wisdom, or their
competency to dictate the proper line of pupilage for their young
relatives.&nbsp; But it is not intended here to insinuate that
the circumstance in question is peculiar to our Lynn
Boarding-schools: on the contrary, the same is supposed to be
very much the case in many, if not in most other places.&nbsp; If
however it be so improper as many have supposed, it would no
doubt, be very desirable to have it discontinued.&nbsp; But the
world is not very likely soon to agree to discontinue all
improper practices.</p>
<p>&#9758; Here before he begins another section, or proceeds any
further, the author begs leave to apprize the reader of an error
he has committed at page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page1134">1134</a></span>, in suggesting that Framingham
endowed 11 out of the 12 dwellings in the Broad street
Almshouse.&nbsp; He has understood since that he endowed but
<i>ten</i>, and that the <i>eleventh</i> was endowed by Ald.
Goodwyn, and the twelfth by the elder <i>Hogg</i>, great grand
father of our present alderman of that name, and founder of that
respectable mercantile family.&nbsp; This correction is made, as
due to the memory of the said <i>Mr. Hogg</i>, which stands much
higher, as a benefactor to the poor, than that of any of our
wealthy men who survived him.&mdash;It is also due to the

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Sketch of the Corporation</i>, <i>with
cursory remarks on its power</i>, <i>possessions</i>,
<i>privileges</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>
<p>The Corporation of Lynn was established in the reign of king
John, which is not mentioned here as a circumstance <a
name="page1150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1150</span>redounding to its honour, or yet to its
dishonour.&nbsp; Our corporations might be very proper and useful
in those feudal and barbarous times, as a check to the despotism
and tyranny of the barons and feudal lords; but in the present
state of the nation their propriety and utility are very far from
being obvious; seeing such places as Birmingham, Manchester, and
Sheffield, appear to have done full as well, and thrived quite as
much, without any chartered immunities, or such a privileged
order of men, as our most famous or favoured corporations.&nbsp;
It is not however to be expected that these dignified bodies will
readily descend from their elevated situations, and place
themselves by the side of their unprivileged neighbours.</p>
<p>The Lynn Corporation is generally considered as consisting of
a Mayor, Recorder, Lord High Steward, twelve Aldermen, eighteen
Common-councilmen, town Clerk, Chamberlain, two Coroners, and
several inferior officers. <a name="citation1150"></a><a
href="#footnote1150" class="citation">[1150]</a>&nbsp; The power,
privileges, and possessions of this body are very considerable,
so that their dignity and consequence seem not a little superior
to those of some others of our corporate bodies in different <a
name="page1151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1151</span>parts of
the kingdom.&nbsp; Their various immunities are distinctly
specified in their numerous charters, which they obtained of
different sovereigns, from John to <a name="page1152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1152</span>Charles the second.&nbsp; But as it
seems to be intended shortly to publish those Charters, it may be
needless to say any more here about their contents.&nbsp; There
has been a pretty general wish for some time to have these
documents published in English, that the freemen might know the
full meaning and extent of the oaths tendered to them in taking
up their freedom, of which not one in twenty of them are supposed
to have at present any adequate idea: and as there is known to
exist now in the town a fair translation of them, it is hoped and
expected that it will ere long be made public.&nbsp; In that case
the dignity, power, and prerogatives of this privileged body will
be sufficiently explained, and our future <a
name="page1153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1153</span>freemen
will be enabled to discover the nature and extent of the
obligation imposed upon them by their burgess oaths.</p>
<p>The possessions of the Lynn Corporation in landed property
&amp;c. are said to be very considerable; and together with their
various tolls, tallages, and privileges, produce a large annual
income, which we are told might be considerably increased, were
their lands all let to the best bidders, or according to their
full value, instead of letting them in the usual unfair and
partial manner, for the accommodation of their own particular
friends and favourites.&nbsp; With such an ample revenue as their
means might be made to produce, and of which they are understood
to be but the trustees of the commonalty, our corporation might
be real and great benefactors to this town, and secure to
themselves the esteem and applause of all their reasonable and
respectable fellow-citizens; but being apt sometimes to carry
themselves rather too haughty and arrogantly towards their
unprivileged neighbours, they are not always in possession of the
respect that would otherwise be very readily paid to them.&nbsp;
It is not however likely that they are much more despotically
disposed than the generality of the rulers of other
corporations.</p>
<p>The <i>mayor</i> of Lynn is chosen annually on the 29th. of
August, from among the aldermen, by the members of the
common-council: and he must be one who has not served the office
previously for at least five years.&nbsp; In <a
name="page1154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1154</span>case he
declines the appointment, or refuses to serve, without reasonable
cause to be allowed, the major and aldermen may fine him in any
sum not exceeding 60<i>l.</i> <a name="citation1154a"></a><a
href="#footnote1154a" class="citation">[1154a]</a>&nbsp; Also in
case of such refusal, or of a mayor&rsquo;s death, the
common-council-men may within eight days choose any other
alderman, who has not served for five years, in his room.&nbsp;
The new mayor being elected on the 29th of August, he is not
sworn in till the 29th. of the ensuing month, or Michaelmas-day,
when his official year commences.&nbsp; If he should happen to be
sick, so as not to be able to attend at the Guild-hall to be
sworn, on the day last mentioned, it shall be lawful to
administer the oath, or oaths to him at his own house, or
wherever he shall be within the borough. <a
name="citation1154b"></a><a href="#footnote1154b"
class="citation">[1154b]</a></p>
<p>Formerly it was customary to have here at the hall, both on
St. John&rsquo;s, and St Michael&rsquo;s days, elegant
entertainments or sumptuous public dinners, given at the
mayor&rsquo;s expense, and often much expatiated upon by former
writers; but the custom has of late been discontinued, and we are
not sure that it will be ever again resumed: nor are we sure that
its resumption would be at all desirable; on the contrary, it
seems more probable that its utter abolition would be of far
greater use to the community in general, at such a time as this,
as it might serve to remind us all of the absolute necessity of
retrenching <a name="page1155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1155</span>and observing the utmost economy in the management of
all our temporal affairs, as the only way to escape starvation
and all its concomitant miseries.&nbsp; For all which we have to
thank the vile maxims that have directed and distinguished our
public affairs for these 50 years, and especially those that
characterize the administration of the last Pitt and his
successors.</p>
<p>Of the present revenue of this Corporation, which is
understood to be very considerable, we have not been able to
ascertain the exact amount.&nbsp; It is one of those secrets, it
seems, which the members make a point of keeping to themselves,
and whose disclosure would render them liable to expulsion.&nbsp;
It being therefore a corporation and sworn secret, we will not
presume to pry any further into it.&nbsp; But it is very certain
that several of their present sources of revenue did not at all
belong to them formerly.&nbsp; Among which are to be reckoned the
possessions of the Gilds of the <i>Trinity</i>, and <i>St.
George</i>, and perhaps of some of the others; which were granted
to the Corporation at the dissolution.&nbsp; Also the profits of
the <i>Toll-booth</i>, which were originally divided between the
<i>bishop of Norwich</i>, and the <i>Earl of Arundel</i> as lord
of <i>Rising</i>, comprehending what is called <i>Tronage</i>,
<i>Measurage</i>, and <i>Lovecop</i>, <a
name="citation1155"></a><a href="#footnote1155"
class="citation">[1155]</a> with the <i>baily-ship of the Water
of Wiggenhall</i>, &amp;c.&nbsp; Of these, after passing through
several hands, a <i>fourth</i> part was vested in the prince of
Wales, as Duke of Cornwall, and the other <i>three</i> parts
afterwards reverted to the crown, and were <a
name="page1156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1156</span>by Henry
VIII. granted to the corporation, who have been in possession of
them ever since.&nbsp; The fourth part is supposed to belong
still to the duchy of Cornwall, and rented from the managers of
its concerns by the mayor and burgesses.&mdash;An
<i>admiralty</i> jurisdiction within the liberties of this
borough, has also been granted to this body corporate, by king
James&rsquo; Charter, which will probably avail them very
materially in their present dispute with lord William
Bentinck.</p>
<p>Before we close these remarks we may just observe, that four
or five of our aldermen, and several of our common-council-men
are now absentees, or live out of town&mdash;a case, it is
supposed, never known here before, and which would not have been
allowed in former days: for absence or removal out of town was
always heretofore succeeded by expulsion, if the absentees did
not think proper to resign of their own accord.&nbsp; It seems
somewhat difficult to account for the unexampled indulgence with
which our present absentees are treated, especially as the mayor
is said to find it often very difficult, on that very account, to
get a Hall, or muster such a number of members as is necessary
for transacting their municipal business.</p>
<p>Other sources of municipal revenue here, are the <i>fairs</i>
and <i>markets</i>.&nbsp; Of the former there are only two in the
year: one of these is very considerable and celebrated, but was
much more so in former times.&nbsp; It is commonly called <i>the
mart</i>, or the <i>Lynn mart</i>, and commences on the 14th. of
February, when it is with great formality <a
name="page1157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1157</span><i>proclaimed</i> <a name="citation1157"></a><a
href="#footnote1157" class="citation">[1157]</a> to last for
<i>six days</i>, but is generally allowed to continue about a
<i>fortnight</i>.&nbsp; It is but the shadow of what it was
formerly, when most of the <a name="page1158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1158</span>town and country shopkeepers were
then supplied with goods till the time of <i>Sturbitch fair</i>,
where they procured a fresh supply.&nbsp; But the latter also is
now sunk into great comparative insignificance.&nbsp; Both of
them therefore might now be discontinued without any material
loss, except to those concerned with their respective
revenues.&nbsp; The other Lynn fair is held on the 17th. of
October, and is called the <i>cheese fair</i>.&nbsp; It was
formerly, it seems, a respectable fair, but is now become so
inconsiderable and insignificant as not to require or merit here
any further notice.</p>
<p>Besides the <i>Fairs</i>, there are at Lynn <i>two weekly
markets</i>, one on <i>Tuesday</i> and the other on
<i>Saturday</i>.&nbsp; They are kept in two different parts of
the town: the former towards the north end, on a spot called the
<i>Tuesday market-place</i>; which is a spacious area of about
three acres, surrounded by very good houses, and having, on an
ascent of four steps, a beautiful free stone <i>Market Cross</i>,
of modern architecture, built in 1710, adorned with statues and
other embellishments, with a peristyle round below, supported by
16 pillars of the Ionic order, as also another walk above,
encompassed with an iron palisade, enriched with tracery work and
foliage, enclosing a neat octagon room, on the outside of which,
in niches, were standing four statues, representing the <a
name="page1159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1159</span>cardinal
virtues, and facing the four cardinal points.&nbsp; The upper
part is finished with a cupola, in which hangs the market-bell,
and the whole is 70 feet high.&nbsp; The foundation having given
way on the west side, it is thought the building ere long must be
taken down.&nbsp; From the cross, in a semicircular direction on
each side, extends a range of covered stalls or shambles, having
a small turret at each end.&nbsp; The <i>fish-market</i>, which
formerly stood behind the cross, has lately been taken down, and
since that time the fish-market is in Common-stath-yard, where a
convenient building had been previously constructed for that
purpose.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The <i>Saturday Market</i> is kept in a convenient area opened
of late years near St. Margaret&rsquo;s church, where capacious
shambles have been erected, over which the Grammar School is
kept.&nbsp; Before 1782 it was kept in that part of High Street
which is next this church; but which being found inconvenient,
the present spot was prepared for that purpose, and it is on the
whole a good commodious market-place.&nbsp; It was however, with
great reluctance that the market people quitted their former
station, and consented to remove to the new one, though it must
have been evident to all that the latter was far
preferable.&nbsp; But that was only the natural effect of that
strange attachment which most people feel for old habits and
customs.&nbsp; Both the Lynn markets are plentifully supplied
with good and excellent provisions, and at as reasonable a rate
as can well be expected in these strange times, when our
<i>guinea</i> is of no more value than <a
name="page1160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1160</span>the
<i>shilling</i> of our ancestors.&nbsp; But we will here close

<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> VII.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Present stele of Lynn</i>, <i>as to its
shipping</i>, <i>trade and commerce</i>, <i>exports and
imports</i>, <i>population</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>
<p>In former times, and even at some pretty remote periods, Lynn
stood high among our English sea-ports, in regard to its
shipping.&nbsp; Hence, as long ago as the year 1374, when Edward
the III was fitting out an expedition against France, and
required his principal sea-ports to furnish ships to enable him
more effectually to accomplish his purpose, he is said to have
had from Lynn 19 ships, when London sent only 24, Bristol 25,
Plymouth, 26, Sandwich 22, Dover 21, Weymouth 20; and Newcastle
only 17, Hull 16, Harwich 14, and Ipswich 12.&nbsp; So that Lynn
appears to have been then among <a name="page1161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1161</span>the first of our sea-ports, as to
the number of its ships, or the extent of its trade and
commerce.&nbsp; In after ages it is supposed to have maintained
its rank among its sister ports; but we are not able to ascertain
the exact degree of its weight and consequence among them during
all the subsequent periods.</p>
<p>Of late years our trade and commerce have fluctuated with the
times, and our shipping and tonnage have increased or decreased
according to the natural operation of a state of peace or of
war.&nbsp; In 1776, being the earliest period at which any record
appears to have been preserved of them, the number of trading
vessels belonging to this port <a name="citation1161"></a><a
href="#footnote1161" class="citation">[1161]</a> was 85, and the
amount of tonnage 12,700; in 1777 and 1778, ( and probably in
1779,) they continued in much the same state, as appears from a
MS. account which belonged to a late shipmaster: but in 1780, or
1781, there was an increase, though we cannot learn how
much.&nbsp; But in 1791 the ships were 125, and tonnage 17,000;
in 1801, ships 108, tonnage 13,000; in 1806, ships 134, tonnage
15,600; in 1811, ships 106, tonnage 12,000.&mdash;From this it
would seem, that our trade is not now in a progressive or
thriving state; and though our shipping are still considerable in
number, yet in point of <i>tonnage</i> they are less than at any
former period here referred to, or probably than at any one
period since the commencement of the present reign.&nbsp; What
effect a peace would have, it is impossible precisely to say, but
the probability is, that our trade would then revive, and things
revert again into their old channels.</p>
<p><a name="page1162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1162</span>The
trade of this town formerly to different parts of the continent
was very considerable, and particularly to the Baltic; but it is
now almost totally deprived of all its foreign trade; and except
some little intercourse with Spain and Portugal, its trade is at
present almost wholly confined to the importation of
<i>Coals</i>, and the exportation of <i>Corn</i> coastwise to
different British ports.&nbsp; The quantity of coals imported
these years is said to have been very great, and that of last
year has perhaps exceeded any other year: and as that article
bears a very heavy duty it has greatly helped to keep up the
revenue of the custom-house.&nbsp; Foreigners, under the licence
system, bringing the produce of the Baltic, may also be supposed
to have contributed considerably to produce the same
effect.&nbsp; The tables below will serve to cast some further
light upon the subject, and help the reader to judge of the trade
of this place for the last fifty years. <a
name="citation1162a"></a><a href="#footnote1162a"
class="citation">[1162a]</a></p>
<p><a name="page1163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1163</span>As
to the <i>Coal-trade</i>, which now constitutes the chief article
or main branch of our remaining commerce, and which of late has
employed so large a portion of our shipping, and is thought
likely to decline considerably this year (1812,) owing to the
price of that commodity having been lately lowered, so as to
diminish the profits so much, that it will be no longer worth the
while of the private ship-owners, who are pretty numerous, to
employ their vessels in the trade: and it is supposed that they
will therefore be obliged to lay them up.&nbsp; This seems a
great hardship upon them, for which our principal merchants are
much blamed, whether justly or not, the present writer will not
take upon him to say.&nbsp; Powerful merchants, most certainly,
as well as powerful men of other professions, have before now
acted very unfairly and oppressively towards their weaker
neighbours.</p>
<p>The trade to <i>Greenland</i> and to <i>Davis&rsquo;s
Straits</i>, or what is called the <i>Whale Fishery</i>, is
another branch in which Lynn has been concerned for many years:
and as it is still persevered in, it may be presumed to have
proved no ungainful concern.&nbsp; The ships fitted out for this
<a name="page1164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1164</span>trade
generally sail in March and return about July.&nbsp; Three or
four ships have been usually employed in this trade, and
sometimes more, but we understand that there are only two fitted
out this year.&nbsp; Some ships also of late years have traded
between this town and Canada, chiefly, we believe, for timber:
and as we are now quite shut out from the Baltic, this trade will
probably increase.&nbsp; On the whole, we presume it may be very
truly said, that the trade of Lynn is at this time at a lower ebb
than it was ever known to be at any time within the last hundred
years or more.&nbsp; When we shall have driven the French out of
Spain and Portugal, and obliged Napoleon to restore all his
conquests, and allow us a free trade to every part of the
continent, it may be hoped it will once more revive and flourish
as much as ever.</p>
<p>The <i>population</i> of Lynn is <i>between ten and eleven
thousand</i>.&nbsp; The census taken in 1801 fixed it at 10,097,
and that taken in 1811 at 10,253.&nbsp; But there is no reliance
to be placed on the accuracy of either.&nbsp; The real population
probably exceeded both these numbers, and it is uncertain at
which of the two periods was the most numerous.&nbsp; Some have
thought that it must have been in 1801, and the present writer
was once of that opinion.&nbsp; What led him to that conclusion
was, the great and unusual number of untenanted houses found in
different parts of the town in 1810, amounting in all to <i>above
one hundred</i>.&nbsp; But observing, upon further deliberation,
that a still greater number of new houses, of a smaller rent, had
lately sprung up in certain alleys and outskirts of the town, and
all tenanted, he was induced to relinquish his former opinion,
and conclude that our <a name="page1165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1165</span>population had not actually
decreased.&nbsp; Nor can he now help thinking the real population
of the town at each of those periods to have much exceeded the
numbers made out by the respective persons employed on the
occasion; and moreover, that our present population is not below
10,500 souls.</p>
<p>Of this population, it is a melancholy consideration that the
greatest part are still very ignorant and unenlightened, and
never frequent any place of worship, and are in fact in a state
of mere heathenism, though they are all absurdly considered as
members of the established church.&nbsp; It is indeed by such
members that this same church is enabled so greatly to outnumber
our great body of dissenters, or the nonconforming party
throughout the nation.&nbsp; Were only the sober and devout on
each side to be numbered, it is highly probable that the
established church, with all its vast wealth, and alliance with
the state, would be found to be the minor party.&nbsp; As to the
regular communicants, it is the opinion of some, that even the
very methodists alone could at present muster a number not
inferior to those of our establishment.&nbsp; Be that as it may,
it must be exceedingly absurd and stupid to consider the
ignorant, the irreligious, and heathenish part of the community
as belonging to any church at all.</p>
<p>The religious functionaries or ministers of this town, both
churchmen and dissenters, are allowed to be in general very
assiduous in the discharge of their clerical and ministerial
duties; and were they at the same time less subject to prejudice,
bigotry, and intolerance, and more disposed to believe what their
Lord and Master has declared, <a name="page1166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1166</span>that <i>they who are not against us
are for us</i>, they would certainly deserve great
commendation.&nbsp; But they and their flocks are, <i>for the
most part</i>, so deficient in the articles of christian charity,
forbearance, and liberality, that they may be said to dishonour
the very cause they have espoused, and the service in which they
are embarked.&nbsp; The more orthodox and evangelical they
pretend to be, the more uncharitable and intolerant they are
generally found.&nbsp; Their evil spirit of intolerance and
infallibility seems to carry them so far as hardly to allow those
who stand without the pale of their respective communions to be
worthy of even the name of christians.&nbsp; Sometimes they have
been heard to pronounce such as they fancied to be heterodox, as
presuming to <i>teach men to be christians without believing any
one principle of that institution</i>; as if God had endowed them
with the infallible knowledge of christian truth, and constituted
them judges of the very state and destinies of their fellow
professors.&nbsp; It was a saying in the primitive times,
&ldquo;See how these christians love one another;&rdquo; but here
it might rather be said, &ldquo;See how these christian parties
and sects envy, vilify, and hate one another.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
short, they may be said to possess so large a portion of that
unworthy spirit of jealousy and rivalry as would disgrace even
the meanest tradesmen, or the very lowest orders of shopkeepers
and mechanics: and what is still worse, they seem quite incapable
of blushing for their absurd and unchristian conduct.&nbsp; There
are however some honourable exceptions to this representation,
though they seem to be very few.&nbsp; But we will now close this
section, and here conclude the regular series of this
history.</p>
<h4><a name="page1167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1167</span><span class="smcap">Supplementary Section</span>;</h4>
<p class="gutsumm">(<i>containing divers recollections</i>,
<i>corrections</i>, <i>and miscellaneous
matters</i>:)&mdash;<i>defects in the plans and modes of public
worship</i>, <i>or the usual proceedings in our religious
assemblies&mdash;our gentry and tradesmen capriciously and
absurdly distinguished&mdash;shrimp
trade&mdash;water-works&mdash;brief account of certain public
buildings previously omitted&mdash;additional hints relating to
our grammar-school</i>, <i>our libraries</i>, <i>and present
population</i>.</p>
<p>To what was said of our religious sects and parties in the
preceding section, under the heads of rivalry, envy,
uncharitableness, &amp;c. it might justly have been added, that
they are also very deficient in their modes of conducting public
worship, or their way and manner of proceeding in their religious
assemblies; and particularly in <i>neglecting</i> as they do the
<i>reading</i> and <i>expounding</i> of the scriptures.&nbsp;
Things would be likely to come to a much better pass, if, at
least, <i>half</i> the time that is now spent in <i>preaching</i>
and <i>singing</i> were appropriated to the important duties of
<i>reading</i> and <i>expounding</i> the sacred writings.&nbsp;
The minds and attention of the people, in that case, would be
directed to the meaning and understanding of holy writ, and a
spirit of enquiry after scripture knowledge could not well fail
of being effectually promoted in our respective
congregations.&nbsp; Instead of that, as the case now stands, or
as the public ministry is at present conducted, the people seem
in general as unacquainted with the scripture at the end of the
year, as they were at the beginning of it, and quite unconcerned
or indifferent about the matter.&nbsp; They appear to attend for
some other purpose&mdash;that of mere amusement, or <a
name="page1168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1168</span>something
very short of what they ought to have in view in attending the
christian ministry.&nbsp; Most preachers seem, as if afraid to
lay the scriptures at large before the people, lest they should
attract too much of their attention, so as to induce them by
degrees to read, think, and judge for themselves, or become
actual searchers of the scripture, and indisposed to take every
thing upon <i>trust</i> from their ghostly guides: for
notwithstanding our usual outcry against the <i>papists</i>, our
priests and theirs are more nearly allied than is generally
supposed.&nbsp; These hints, it is presumed, are not altogether
unworthy of the serious consideration of the different
religionists of this town. <a name="citation1168"></a><a
href="#footnote1168" class="citation">[1168]</a></p>
<p>Except these of the learned professions, and <i>very few</i>
besides, all the principal families of this town are in fact
<i>tradesmen</i>; yet even these are here very capriciously and
superciliously distinguished into <i>gentlemen</i> and
<i>tradesmen</i>; though the former retale their goods, or sell
their commodities in small quantities, as well as the latter: and
surely a man who buys corn by the bushel, the coomb, or the
quarter, and sells coals by the chalder and half chalder, and his
deals in any small quantity the <a name="page1169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1169</span>buyer may wish, and his bottled
wine by single dozens, is to all intents and purposes as much a
tradesman as a grocer, a linen-draper, an ironmonger, or a
druggist.&nbsp; What then is the ground of this
distinction?&nbsp; Is it education?&nbsp; No: our tradesmen in
general have been brought up at the grammar-school, and the
others can seldom or ever pretend to any higher advantage.&nbsp;
Nor do they possess minds more cultivated by reading and
knowledge of the world; for there is every reason to believe that
the tradesmen are at least their equals in those respects, and
some of them perhaps very much their superiors.&nbsp; But is not
fortune or <i>wealth</i> the ground of this distinction?&nbsp;
No: many of those denominated tradesmen are known to be much more
wealthy, as well as much more intelligent and respectable, than
some of those who have arrogated to themselves the dignified name
of gentlemen.&nbsp; On what then can this curious distinction be
founded?&nbsp; It may very truly be answered, On pride,
arrogance, ignorance, impertinence, and vulgar servility. <a
name="citation1169"></a><a href="#footnote1169"
class="citation">[1169]</a></p>
<p>In treating of our trade and commerce, in the preceding
section, that remarkable branch or article, the
<i>shrimp-trade</i>, was quite forgotten; and some perhaps may
think that it might as well still remain so: others however will
be of a different opinion; at least when they learn that beside
what has been consumed in the town <a name="page1170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1170</span>and parts adjacent, and up the
country, there have been actually sent from hence to London
alone, by the stage coaches, in one season, or within a year, no
less then between <i>sixty and seventy tons of shrimps</i>. <a
name="citation1170"></a><a href="#footnote1170"
class="citation">[1170]</a>&nbsp; It is a vast quantity to be
sent by land, and coach carriage, to the distance of a hundred
miles.&nbsp; We have not learnt how long this trade has been kept
up on this large scale.&nbsp; It is said to have somewhat
declined since the Bostonians have taken it up and become our
rivals.&nbsp; But this rivalship can do no harm, as London, no
doubt, will readily receive as many shrimps as both these towns
can possibly furnish.</p>

<p>The <i>Water-works</i> of this town are also among the
articles overlooked in the preceding part of this history.&nbsp;
It is agreed on all hands that Lynn is supplied with excellent
water from the Gaywood river, a stream that takes its rise about
Grimston, six or seven miles off.&nbsp; At the Kettle-mills, in
the north-east outskirt of Lynn, this water is raised into a
reservoir, which is between 30 and 40 feet higher than the
surface of the water in the river.&nbsp; Formerly there were two
engines used for this purpose.&nbsp; One of them was worked by a
fall of water in the river, and the other by horses.&nbsp; This
latter was used when the water-engine was under repairs, or in
dry seasons when the water-engine had not sufficient power to
supply the <a name="page1171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1171</span>town.&nbsp; In very dry seasons the hire of horses was
very expensive.&nbsp; About the year 1779 or 1780 the
water-engine became unfit for further use.&nbsp; A new one being
then erected on better principles, had near three times the power
of the old one.&nbsp; Thus the town was plentifully supplied with
water for some years, and at a small expense, as the horse-engine
was seldom used.&nbsp; But unfortunately the corporation came
afterwards to a resolution to have the town supplied with water
by the force of <i>steam</i>.&nbsp; A fire-engine was erected,
which afforded an ample supply of water to the town; in
consequence of which the horse and water engines were taken
down.&nbsp; But the corporation, neglecting to avail themselves
of the improvements of Bolton and Watts, erected their engine on
the old principle of Newcomen; and it was soon discovered, to the
astonishment of the unlearned in hydraulics, that the expense of
coals and repairs amounted to a sum so far beyond the calculation
of the corporation, that it was absolutely necessary to purchase
no more steam at that rate.&mdash;The town is now supplied by an
engine turned by water; but as it is constructed on old
principles, the town, in dry seasons, must be ill-supplied and
much distressed: and as the steam engine is become unfit for
further use, the town must always be without a drop of water
while the water engine is under repairs, which sometimes takes up
more than a fortnight.&nbsp; This is an inconvenience which the
town is said never to have experienced until the late alterations
were made.&nbsp; On the whole therefore, this business appears to
have been injudiciously managed; so that it would be very
desirable to see it put upon a better footing, which it <a
name="page1172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1172</span>certainly
ought to be, as there has lately been an advance made in the
water-rate&mdash;for which no plausible reason is known to have
been yet assigned, any more than for the unexpected advance in
the price of <i>beer</i>.</p>
<p>In our preceding account of <i>the public buildings</i>, it
now appears that divers of them have passed unnoticed, and
particularly the <i>Theatre</i>, the <i>Custom-Haute</i>, and the
<i>Town-Hall</i>; each of which we shall now briefly
describe.&nbsp; The <i>Theatre</i> was originally the Hall of an
opulent company, which constituted one of our numerous
<i>Guilds</i>, that of <i>St. George</i>.&nbsp; After the
dissolution of the Guilds it was converted it seems into a kind
of <i>Exchange</i>, and after that into a <i>court-house</i>, for
holding the county quarter sessions of the peace.&nbsp; Since
those sessions were allowed to be held in the town-hall it has
been converted into a Theatre, or Play-house, which is said to be
very convenient and neat, neither profusely ornamented nor
disgustingly plain; and although not free from faults, yet they
are, it seems, what resulted from the architect having to fill up
the shell of an old building which had been erected for another
purpose.&nbsp; The usual time of performing here is in the
Spring, when the inhabitants are entertained by the Norwich
Company.</p>
<p>The <i>Custom House</i> was erected for an <i>Exchange</i>, in
1683, by Sir John Turner, the founder it is supposed of that
family.&nbsp; It is a handsome free-stone building, with two
tiers of pilasters, the lower of the Doric, and the upper of the
Ionic order, with a small open turret, <a
name="page1173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1173</span>terminating in a pinnacle.&nbsp; In a niche, in front,
is a statue of king Charles the second, that <i>most
religious</i> king, as his bishops and clergy used to call him,
even in their addresses to the deity.&nbsp; This building
contains several commodious apartments, well suited for the
accommodation of the respectable collector of his majesty&rsquo;s
customs and his numerous underlings.&mdash;It has been noticed
before that the revenue of this house, in 1806 amounted to
84,200<i>l.</i> and the last year (1811,) to 75,300<i>l.</i>
which is said to exceed the revenue of most houses of the same
description in the kingdom. <a name="citation1173"></a><a

<p>The <i>Town-hall</i>, or <i>Guild-hall</i>, alias
<i>Trinity-hall</i>, is an ancient building of stone and
flint.&nbsp; It consists of divers apartments, the first of which
is the <i>stone-hall</i>, where the county quarter sessions, as
well as the town sessions are held.&nbsp; This hall,
comprehending probably the principal part of the old Guild-hall,
is 58 feet in length, by 27 wide, and proportionably lofty.&nbsp;
There are in it the following <i>portraits</i>:&mdash;Full-length
of <i>Sir Robert Walpole</i>, who is said to have been returned
for this borough seventeen times; and so firmly was it attached
to him, or so completely under his control, that even after he
was expelled the House of Commons he still continued member for
this place: Also half length of Sir <i>Thomas White</i>, the
liberal benefactor to young tradesmen: Likewise a half length of
<i>Sir </i><a name="page1174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1174</span><i>Benjamin Keene</i>, the memorable ambassador to the
Spanish Court, who was a native of this town.&mdash;The adjoining
<i>Ball-room</i> is 60 feet long, 27 broad, and 22 feet
high.&nbsp; The adjoining <i>Card-room</i> is 27 feet by 27, and
22 feet in height.&nbsp; Some have pronounced these rooms ill
contrived and have observed that, as they are upon a line, it
would have given them an uncommon elegance had the openings from
one into another been in three arches in the centre, supported by
pillars, instead of the present <i>Glass-doors</i>, which have a
mean appearance.&nbsp; The eye, it has been further observed,
would then at once have commanded a suit of one hundred and
forty-five feet, which, with handsome lustres properly disposed,
would have rendered these rooms inferior to few in England.&nbsp;
The position of the <i>music gallery</i> has also been found
fault with.&nbsp; But on these matters we will not enlarge: nor
does it seem necessary to subjoin a particular description of the
<i>Council-room</i> and other apartments or offices connected
with this building. <a name="citation1174"></a><a
href="#footnote1174" class="citation">[1174]</a></p>
<p><a name="page1175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1175</span>As
Lynn has not been much distinguished for its literature or
bookishness, it can be no great wonder that it should not abound
with public libraries.&nbsp; Till of late years there was here
nothing of the kind, except in the two churches of St. Nicholas
and St. Margaret, each of which was furnished with a
library.&nbsp; That of the former is now no more: it was removed
some years ago to the other church, by way of addition to that
collection.&nbsp; Both being thus consolidated or united, form
what is called the <i>Church library</i>.&nbsp; It may be said to
be, on the whole, a respectable collection, consisting of the
donations of divers individuals, at different times; but it has
never been supported with much spirit, nor has it received any
great addition now for many years; owing, perhaps, to the
unliterary or unbookish character of our corporation, and of most
of our great and wealthy families.&nbsp; St. Nicholas&rsquo;
Library, it seems, was founded in 1617, and that of St.
Margaret&rsquo;s about 14 years later.&nbsp; This was much
augmented in 1714, by the will of <i>Dr. Thomas Thurlin</i>,
master of St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, and rector of
Gaywood, who bequeathed to it 179 folios, 178 octavos and
duodecimo&rsquo;s, and 84 quartos; in all 441 volumes, valued
then at 160<i>l.</i> which it is presumed was the best single
donation ever made to this Library.&nbsp; This bibliothecal
collection is the property of the corporation, and is under the
care of a librarian of their appointment, with an annual salary
of 2<i>l.</i>&nbsp; It is not open to the public at large, and is
not therefore, strictly speaking, a public library.&nbsp; It
contains about 1700 volumes.</p>
<p><a name="page1176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1176</span>Before the year 1797, our reading and bookish people
chiefly consisted of the members of a few <i>book-clubs</i>,
which then existed in the town; together with the subscribers to
those <i>circulating libraries</i>, (made up mostly of
<i>novels</i>,) which our booksellers had formed, and which
constituted, if it do not still constitute, a lucrative branch of
their trade; for <i>novel-reading</i> is carried on hereon a
large scale, especially among the female part of our population;
to which not a few of them probably owe all the polish, real or
fictitious, which their manners have acquired.&mdash;But in the
year 1797 a subscription Library was here founded, which has been
hitherto in a thriving way, and it has at present upwards of a
hundred members.&nbsp; The rules or orders of this society
consist of about twenty, and are, on the whole, well expressed
and adapted to the occasion. <a name="citation1176"></a><a
href="#footnote1176" class="citation">[1176]</a>&nbsp; A general
meeting of the society is <a name="page1177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1177</span>held <i>annually</i>, on the
<i>first Monday</i> in <i>July</i>, (the anniversary of the
establishment of the Library in 1797.)&nbsp; <i>Quarterly</i>
meetings are also held, on the <i>first Mondays</i> in
<i>October</i>, <i>January</i>, and <i>April</i>, every
year.&nbsp; Each subscriber may propose what books he pleases for
the Library, (except such as ape <i>merely professional</i>,
<i>political pamphlets</i>, or <i>Novels</i>,) by entering their
Titles and Prices in a book kept for that purpose.&nbsp; But they
must be so entered a week at least before the general or
quarterly meeting, otherwise they cannot lawfully be then
balloted: nor must the same book be balloted for more than
<i>twice</i> in one year.&nbsp; A <i>librarian</i>, (who is also
<i>treasurer</i>) and a <i>sub-librarian</i>, are annually
chosen; the latter gives daily attendance at the library, from
<i>eleven</i> to <i>one</i>, and from <i>six</i> to
<i>eight</i>.&nbsp; The present number of different articles or
<i>works</i> in this library amounts to about 600, and the number
of <i>volumes</i> to near 1400; many of them very valuable and
expensive.&nbsp; They are all new books.</p>
<p>Here in addition to what was before advanced, at pages <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page1164">1164</a></span> and <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page1165">1165</a></span>, relating
to our present population, it seems proper and necessary to say
something further upon that subject, as <i>West Lynn</i>, or
<i>Old Lynn</i>, and <i>Gaywood</i>, <a
name="citation1177"></a><a href="#footnote1177"
class="citation">[1177]</a> which may justly be denominated
<i>out suburbs</i>, were not included in that reckoning.&nbsp;
Now the population of these two places amounts to about 800,
which added to 10,253, will make our whole population somewhat to
exceed eleven thousand: and as this does not comprehend our
<i>sea faring people</i>, who are very numerous, <a
name="page1178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1178</span>our whole
or actual population may be very reasonably and safely supposed
to be now no less than twelve thousand.&nbsp; Yet this is
probably much below what it has been in former times.</p>
<p>In addition also to what was said of the <i>pictures</i> in
the town-hall, it may be proper here just to add, that the
Ball-room there contains two whole lengths, the one of his
present <i>Majesty</i> in his coronation robes, and the other of
the late <i>Lord Nelson</i>.&nbsp; The former a copy, from an
original by Sir Joshua Reynolds, and the latter a copy, from an
original by Hoppner&mdash;both done by <i>Mr. Lane</i>, son to
our present collector, and said to do no small credit to the
skill and talents of that young artist, who is supposed to be the
very first native of Lynn that has ever promised to rise to
eminence in that line.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Lynn Benefactions</i>, <i>or
Charities</i>.</p>
<p>Here it was intended to close the work, by a table or
<i>summary of remarkable events</i>, chronologically arranged;
but considering that our different <i>benefactions</i> and
<i>charities</i> seemed to require to be more fully stated and
particularized, it was thought proper to give first a cursory
view of that subject&mdash;Among these charities the first place
perhaps is due to the <i>endowment of the grammar-school</i>;
which may probably be ascribed to one of the <i>Thorsbys</i>,
sometime before the reformation, whose Will is noticed at page
<span class="indexpageno"><a href="#page1174">1174</a></span>,
and who it is supposed was that same Thorsby mentioned before at
p. 528, as founder of the <i>college</i> in this town.&nbsp; It
is likely he might fit <a name="page1179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1179</span>up the place over the charnel-house
for a school-room, settle on the master a house to dwell in, and
an annual salary.&nbsp; He was contemporary with <i>Walter
Coney</i>, and like him wealthy, and also ready to employ his
wealth in acts of liberality and charity, which has made his
memory truly respectable.</p>
<p><i>Sir Thomas White</i>, citizen and alderman of London, who
lived in queen Mary&rsquo;s time, was another of our early
benefactors.&nbsp; He gave during his life 2000<i>l.</i> to the
city of <i>Bristol</i> to purchase lands of the yearly value of
120<i>l.</i> for which it was agreed that the mayor and
corporation of that city, in 1567 and the ten ensuing years,
should pay the sum of 100<i>l.</i> which having for that time
been allowed to accumulate, was to be thus expended: 800<i>l.</i>
to be divided in loans without interest, among sixteen young
Clothiers, freemen of that city, for ten years, upon sufficient
security; at the aid of which time that sum to be lent to such
other persons as the desire of the mayor, alderman, and four of
the common council shall point out.&nbsp; The remaining 200 to be
expended in the purchase of corn to be sold to the poor at prime
cost.&nbsp; At the expiration of nine years at the feast of St.
Bartholomew he directed that 104<i>l.</i> should be paid to the
mayor and corporation of <i>York</i>, to be lent by them to four
young freemen of that city, (clothiers always preferred.)&nbsp;
The same sum the next year on the same conditions, to the city of
<i>Canterbury</i>: the next to <i>Reading</i>, the next to the
<i>Merchant Tailors&rsquo; company</i>; the next to
<i>Gloucester</i>, and so on successively, to <i>Worcester</i>,
<i>Exeter</i>, <i>Salisbury</i>, <i>Norwich</i>,
<i>Southampton</i>, <i>Lincoln</i>, <i>Winchester</i>, <a
name="page1180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1180</span><i>Hereford</i>, <i>Oxford</i>, <i>Cambridge</i>,
<i>Shrewsbury</i>, <span class="smcap"><i>Lynn</i></span>,
<i>Bath</i>, <i>Derby</i>, <i>Ipswich</i>, <i>Colchester</i>,
<i>Newcastle</i>; and then to begin again at Bristol, and to
proceed annually and regularly to the other places for
ever.&mdash;Lynn first received this money (if we are not
mistaken) in 1594; then in 1618, then in 1642; it next became due
in 1666, but was put off for three years, till 1669, on account
of the seat of the late rebellion (as it was said) having been
where the estate lay.&nbsp; The rent was therefore lost for three
years.&nbsp; The next payments was made in 1693.&nbsp; The next
was received in 1724, the payment having been retarded because
the corporations refused to allow taxes, which were unjustly
insisted upon by the city of Bristol: at last however, rather
than go to law, they agreed to allow those taxes.&nbsp; How many
times Lynn has received this money since, we have not learnt; but
suppose it has been paid pretty regularly; so that our
corporation ought to have now in hand a large sum to lend to poor
tradesmen.&nbsp; The present expence of <i>stamps</i> is said to
have in a great measure destroyed the benevolent intention and
use of this benefaction.</p>
<p>But one of the principal charities belonging to this town is
that which bears the name of Mr. <i>John Crane</i>, an apothecary
of Cambridge, about the time of Charles the First and the Common
Wealth.&nbsp; It consists of 147 acres and one rood of land, at
Fleet in Lincolnshire, or rather arises out of the rental of that
land, which now amounts to 395<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> a year, which
comes to Lynn by rotation every five years, as it belongs
successively to the town of Cambridge, the university of
Cambridge, <a name="page1181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1181</span>the town of Ipswich, the town of Wisbeach, and the
town of Lynn.&nbsp; The rental being originally only 62<i>l.</i>
was appropriated to each of these places successively, till each
of them should receive to the amount of 200<i>l.</i>&nbsp; From
each payment the sum of 20<i>l.</i> a-piece was to be lent to
<i>three</i> young tradesmen, without interest, for 20
years.&nbsp; The odd forty shillings to be given to the minister
who should be appointed to preach, at the place which received
the money, a commemoration sermon to stir up others to the like
charitable deeds.&nbsp; Afterwards the benefaction to continue to
each place for ever, and supplied as follows; viz. to relieve
honest old men and women in distress, and release from prison
poor men confined there for debt.&nbsp; The testator changes
those entrusted with the management of this concern (as they will
answer it before God) to relieve the <i>most honest and most
religious men and women</i> in their several places, who had
lived well, had a good report, and had been reduced by mere
misfortune, or through no fault of their own: and he cautions
them against applying any part of his benefaction to the relief
of <i>dissembling hypocritical persons</i>.&nbsp; The chief part
of this statement the author has drawn, with some abridgement,
from a MS. account, once the property of a former alderman.&nbsp;
He has not been able to learn how this charity is now applied by
our corporation: only that it is at the disposal of the mayor and
the four senior aldermen.</p>
<p>Other charities are as follow&mdash;15<i>l.</i> given by
<i>Robert Boston</i> alias <i>Tyler</i>, to be lent from year to
year to deserving objects.&mdash;Also <i>John Strogers</i> of
Lynn, Cook, by will, <a name="page1182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1182</span>25 April, 1670, gave 45<i>l.</i> to
the mayor and burgesses, that 20<i>s.</i> per annum might be paid
to the minister of St. Margaret&rsquo;s to preach a sermon the
1st. of January, and 14<i>s.</i> to 14 widowers and widows in
Trinity-Hall ward, and 10<i>s.</i> to ten poor women in Stonegate
ward upon the 20th. of December; and 10<i>l.</i> to the mayor and
burgesses to buy a piece of plate.&mdash;Also <i>Edward
Robinson</i>, born and educated in this town, by will, dated
April 12, 1770, gave a capital tenement, in Lath Street, to the
mayor and burgesses, and their successors forever, upon the
trusts, and to the uses, intents, and purposes
following&mdash;<i>viz.</i> To pay 1<i>l.</i> to the curate of
St. Margaret&rsquo;s church, to preach a sermon there every Good
Friday for ever&mdash;and to pay to 12 poor decayed seamen, or
other decayed aged men, that the mayor, aldermen, and
common-council shall elect, for life, upon each Good Friday, ten
shillings apiece:&mdash;and (after paying <i>one pound</i> on St.
Thomas&rsquo;s day to the minister and church wardens of
<i>Thornham</i>,) to distribute the remainder of the rents among
such 12 poor men as shall be placed in the Broad Street
Almshouse, above 60 years of age.&mdash;Also Mr. <i>John
Horn</i>, the memorable master of the Grammar-school, by his Will
dated 27 April 1731, after sundry Legacies given to his
relations, directed the residue of his estate to be sold, and the
produce to be paid to the mayor and aldermen, to be by them put
out at interest, and that interest to be by them yearly for ever
employed for binding out of poor children
apprentices.&mdash;Moreover, of late years, <i>Mary Leake</i>,
widow, of this town, bequeathed 200<i>l.</i> to the mayor,
aldermen, and common-council, to be put out at interest, and the
produce applied, as before, to <a name="page1183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1183</span>bind poor children
apprentices:&mdash;also her sister <i>Catherine Barwell</i>,
bequeathed 300<i>l.</i> to the same trustees, the interest
whereof to be laid out in purchasing coals, to be given away to
such industrious poor women as receive no parish
relief.&mdash;The last, but not the least of all our
benefactions, is that of the late <i>Mr. Cook</i> of London, who
bequeathed 5000<i>l.</i> 3 per cent stock, in trust to the mayor
and burgesses, the interest whereof to be applied for the benefit
of the three almshouses in the town: viz. that of 2300<i>l.</i>
to the <i>Bede-house</i>, that of 700<i>l.</i> to the
<i>South-Lynn</i> almshouse, and that of 2000<i>l.</i> to the
almshouse in <i>Broad-Street</i>.</p>
<p>To those above enumerated may be added the following
benefactions.&mdash;Viz. <i>Loneyson&rsquo;s</i> annuity of
10<i>l.</i> to St. James&rsquo; Hospital; from 75 acres of
pasture land in the south marshes. (see p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page1134">1134</a></span>)&mdash;Also 30<i>s.</i> a year
towards cloathing two poor widows, arising from a Legacy of
40<i>l.</i> bequeathed by <i>Joan Maye</i> to the mayor and
burgesses, about 1660.&mdash;Also 40<i>s.</i> a year, for 7
years, to a <i>poor scholar</i>, a native of Lynn, who shall go
thence to the university of Cambridge; being a bequest of <i>Alex
Hall</i>, merchant of this town, who died about 1597.&mdash;Also
16<i>s.</i> or 3<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a year for the
term of <i>five years</i>, (out of Nottely tithes in North
Runcton) to a <i>poor scholar</i>, chosen out of the poorest
scholars of this Free-school, by the master and vicar master of
Trinity College Cambridge, and the mayor of Lynn: being the gift,
it seems, of <i>Richard Hopps</i>.&mdash;Also <i>John
Pierson</i>, carpenter, left 6<i>l.</i> per annum by his Will
dated 22. Oct. <a name="page1184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1184</span>1623, as follows; <i>viz.</i> 40<i>s.</i> a year to a
<i>poor scholar</i>, who shall go out of the grammar school of
this town to any college in Cambridge, to be continued during the
first seven years of his abiding there; also the same sum of
40<i>s.</i> every Lent season to the poor people in the Lynn
Almshouse, (the <i>Bedehouse</i> we presume;) and another sum of
40<i>s.</i> to the poor people in <i>Stone gate-ward</i>, to be
distributed also in the Lent season by the direction of the mayor
for the time being, or the alderman of the said
ward.&mdash;Beside these there is the <i>Token-money</i>,
consisting of the sum of about 43<i>l.</i> annually laid out in
<i>coals</i>, which are distributed in single mets, or some such
small quantities among the poor in the different wards.&nbsp;
When or whence this money originated the author cannot distinctly
say, but he understands it to be of pretty long standing, and the
gift of some well disposed person or persons, of other
times.&nbsp; He also understands from good authority that <i>all
the charities</i>, or <i>benefactions now in the gift of the
corporation</i>, <i>amount to the annual sum of</i> 498<i>l.</i>
16<i>s.</i> <i>exclusive of the endowments of the different
Almshouses</i>. <a name="citation1184"></a><a

<p><a name="page1185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1185</span>&#9758; Since the above was sent to the press, the
author got sight of a curious old book which belonged to a former
town-chamberlain, (Jos. Cooper senr.) in which <a
name="page1186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1186</span>the
following charities are recorded.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Mrs. Titloe</i>, about 1613, left a
Legacy to the town, the interest whereof, amounting to
11<i>l.</i> annually, to be paid to Emanuel College Cambridge:
8<i>l.</i> of which to be paid to <i>two</i> scholars that have
gone from this Free-school thither: the remaining 3<i>l.</i> to
the fellows towards the repairs of the chapel.&mdash;Also
<i>Matthew Clarke</i>, alderman, gave 10<i>l.</i> the interest to
be divided among 20 poor widows in the 10 wards, [interest then
at 10 per cent.]&mdash;Also <i>Mrs. Jane Gurlin</i>, maid, gave
20<i>l.</i> to be lent out for three years gratis.&mdash;Also
<i>Wm. Cleave</i> Esq. of London, gave a house situated at the
corner of Grass-Market, let at 13<i>l.</i> per annum, the rent to
be distributed to the poor of St. Margaret&rsquo;s parish, at the
discretion of the minister, church-wardens, and overseen of the
same.&mdash;Also <i>Gyles Bridgman</i>, alderman, (mayor in 1679)
gave 100<i>l.</i> to the mayor and burgesses on trust, the
interest to be paid for ever to the master and widows, or sisters
in the almshouse (<i>Bedehouse</i>) by way of augmentation of
their weekly pensions.&mdash;Also, Nov. 10, 1721, <i>Mrs. Margery
Brock</i>, gave 20<i>l.</i> the interests to be laid out in
coals, and given to 4 poor widows in St. Margaret&rsquo;s parish
for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then it is also added, that Alderman Auborne&rsquo;s Charity
was first disposed of at Christmas 1741.</p>
<p>But it must not be here forgotten that this same old book also
discovers the origin and founder of the Lynn <i>Grammar
School</i>, which had we obtained a sight of in time, would have
saved us those useless conjectures at pages <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page1140">1140</a></span>, <span

The passage alluded to is as follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Mr. Thos. Thorisby</i>, alderman, and
sometimes mayor, built a chapple adjoining to the south side of
the church of St. Margarets, and gave to the master of the
Charnell House, (now the <i>Free</i> School,) certain lands in
Gaywood, to the value, of 8<i>l.</i> per annum, for teaching
Grammar and Songs, and also for singing <a
name="page1188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1188</span>durges,
(dirges,) dayly in the said chapple: which land became forfeited
to the crowne, and invented in the Corporation by Charter of
Edward VI.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus is the origin of our grammar-school at last sufficiently
cleared up, which seems to have been founded in the reign of
Edward IV, or that of Henry VII, when Thorsby flourished and was
thrice mayor of this town.&mdash;see more of him at p. 528.</p>

<h2>TABLE OF EVENTS.</h2>
<p>A <span class="GutSmall">TABLE</span> <i>of memorable</i>,
<i>or somewhat remarkable events</i>, <i>relating to this
town</i>, <i>from the Conquest to the present time</i>;
<i>including what is most worthy of preservation in
Mackerell</i>, <i>and divers private </i><span
class="GutSmall"><i>MSS.</i></span><i> belonging to certain of
our most curious townsmen</i>: <i>the whole chronologically
arranged and brought down to the present year</i>&mdash;1812.</p>
<p>A.D. 1066.&nbsp; This year the French conquered England, and
their commander, the Norman Bastard, seated himself on the
English throne, which was also possessed by his descendants for
many generations: Lynn of course felt the effects of this
revolution and readily acceded to the new order of things.&nbsp;
<i>Stigand</i>, archbishop of Canterbury, and his brother
<i>Ailmar</i>, bishop of Elmham, were before the great men that
bore sway here; but they were now ousted, and their power and
possessions transferred by the Conqueror to two of his French
adherents, <i>Odo</i> bishop of Baieux, in Normandy, his half
brother, and <i>Herfast</i>, one of his own chaplains.&nbsp;
Frenchmen then got possession of almost all the land in the
kingdom, and they were the progenitors of most of our present
noble families; so that our House of Lords is now in a great
measure made up of their descendants.</p>
<p>1100.&nbsp; About this time St. Margaret&rsquo;s church was
built by bishop Herbert, who granted long indulgences to the
people to commit all manner of sin, by way of encouragement or
inducement to contribute towards the completion of the sacred
edifice; as if he thought that to give people their full swing in
all manner of iniquity, was the surest way to make them pious and
liberal.</p>
<p><a name="page1189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1189</span>About the same time was also built the Benedictine
Priory, on the south side of the church.</p>
<p>1144.&nbsp; A Priory at Gaywood was founded in honour of Mary
Magdalen, whence it is still called <i>St. Mary Magdalen&rsquo;s
Hospital</i>.&nbsp; The priory has long disappeared, and has been
succeeded by the present Hospital.&nbsp; The founder&rsquo;s name
was <i>Petrus Capellanus</i>, who died in 1174.&mdash;see p. 530,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>1190.&nbsp; A terrible riot and commotion here, and in many
other parts of the kingdom, excited, it seems, for the purpose of
plundering and massacring the poor <i>Jews</i>, who were then
settled in great numbers here and in many of our great
towns.&nbsp; Of what then occurred here see vol. I. page 391 of
this work.</p>
<p>1204.&nbsp; This town was constituted a Borough by royal
charter, and its chief magistrate was at the same time, or soon
after, denominated <i>Mayor</i>, see page 393.&nbsp; These
honours were the royal gifts of king <i>John</i>, who repeatedly
visited this town.&nbsp; His last visit was in the autumn of
1216.&nbsp; He soon after died at Newark, and was interred at
Worcester, where his remains were discovered in 1797 in a state
of remarkable preservation, considering that they had lain in the
ground near 600 years.</p>
<p>1233.&nbsp; King Henry 3. granted his first charter to this
town, in confirmation of that of his father, 28 years before.</p>
<p>1268.&nbsp; The same sovereign granted our corporation a
second charter with more ample privileges, in consideration of
<i>the faithful and laudable service</i>, and valiant
<i>assistance</i> which our burgesses had rendered him in the
late troubles of his kingdom.</p>
<p>1271.&nbsp; Lynn said to be then a fortified town: but it was
probably so ever since, or very soon after it received its first
charter, if not before.</p>
<p>1330.&nbsp; The queen dowager <i>Isabel</i> took up her
residence at <i>Rising Castle</i> by Lynn, where she continued to
reside afterwards as long as she lived, which was 28 years; in
the course of which time her son Edw. III. his queen Philippa,
and their son the black prince, repeatedly visited her there: and
there can be no doubt of their having also frequently visited
this town in the mean time.</p>
<p>1340.&nbsp; The king and queen were at Rising for some time,
as appears by the account rolls of Adam de Reffham and John de
Newland of Lynn, who sent his majesty at the same time a present
of wine.&mdash;Previous to the king&rsquo;s arrival the queen
dowager sent her precept to the mayor of Lynn, for 8 carpenters
to assist in making the necessary preparations.</p>
<p>1344.&nbsp; The king and his court were here for some time, as
appears from certain letters which he sent from hence to the
bishop of Norwich, then at <i>Avignon</i>, to be there delivered
by him to the pope.</p>
<p>1349.&nbsp; A dreadful plague or pestilence, which had broke
out in the north of Asia, made its destructive way soon into
Europe, and now to <a name="page1190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1190</span>England.&nbsp; It is said to have
raged so much in some countries that scarcely a tenth part of the
population escaped.&nbsp; It was called <i>the black death</i>,
and is said to have swept away in Norfolk alone, 57,374 persons,
from January to July, and 7000 of them in the town of
<i>Yarmouth</i>.&nbsp; We cannot find how many perished then at
Lynn, but the number was doubtless very great, as the disorder
then raged terribly throughout the whole county.&nbsp; Most of
the clergy seem to have then perished; hence we are told that 850
persons were, by the bishop of this diocese instituted and
collated to benefices which had now become vacant&mdash;50,000
persons were carried off in <i>London</i>, and as many at
<i>Paris</i>.&mdash;see p. 358 of this work, and Andr. 1.
372.</p>
<p>1369.&nbsp; An order was made that no Roadsman should charge
more than 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for pylotting in any
stranger&rsquo;s ship from the channel to the town.</p>
<p>1380.&nbsp; The pope granted his license for christening in
St. Nicholas&rsquo;s chapel; which must of course, in the public
estimation, have added greatly to the sanctity and dignity of the
place.</p>
<p>1381.&nbsp; An ordinance made for the inhabitants of this town
to merchandise.&mdash;Another account says&mdash;it was an order,
or ordinance for settling of merchandise in this town&mdash;both
seem too ambiguous and mysterious to make out.&nbsp; But it was
in the reign of Richard 2. when many strange ordinances were
made, and many vile measures pursued.&nbsp; Except his
<i>mother</i>, and especially his <i>queen</i>, whom his subjects
used to call <i>the good queen Ann</i>, <a
name="citation1190"></a><a href="#footnote1190"
class="citation">[1190]</a> there was about his court but little
that could be deemed respectable.&nbsp; His favourite method of
raising money was by a loan: a few instances of the respective
sums he demanded of his subjects as they stand in the
<i>F&aelig;dera</i>, will shew the comparative wealth of Lynn,
and other places at that period.&mdash;From <i>London</i> 10,000
marks: from <i>York</i>, <i>Gloucester</i>, <i>Salisbury</i>, and
<i>Lincoln</i>, each 200 ditto.&mdash;From <i>Cambridge</i>,
<i>Canterbury</i>, and <i>Southampton</i>, each 100
ditto.&mdash;From <i>Bristol</i>, 300 ditto.&mdash;From
<i>Norwich</i>, 500 ditto.&mdash;From <i>Lynn</i>, 400 ditto.</p>
<p>1384.&nbsp; Our <i>bishop Spencer</i> went abroad at the head
of a crusade, or army, of 50,000 foot and 2000 horse, to fight
for pope <i>Urban</i>, against pope <i>Clement</i>: for there
were then two heads of the catholic church, which made it a
perfect monster.&nbsp; In this memorable crusade great numbers of
Norfolk and Lynn people were doubtless enlisted.</p>
<p>1399.&nbsp; <i>Sir William Sawtre</i>, (minister of St.
Margaret&rsquo;s,) prosecuted here for <i>Lollardism</i>, (much
the same with what we call <i>protestantism</i>,) and forced to
recant; but relapsing soon after, he was taken up and burnt for
his reputed heresy.&nbsp; He is called the English
proto-matryr.&mdash;see more of him at p. 580, &amp;c.</p>
<p><a name="page1191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1191</span>1403.&nbsp; Two fierce factions sprung up here and
disturbed the peace of the town for 30 years; at their heads were
two aldermen of that time, <i>Wentworth</i> and
<i>Pettipas</i>.&mdash;see p. 364, &amp;c.</p>
<p>1417.&nbsp; Our mayor and aldermen and other merchants
obtained from Henry V. a warrant to elect an alderman for Denmark
and Norway: of which see more, p. 485.</p>
<p>1446.&nbsp; King Henry VI. came to Lynn and ordered the sword
to be borne before the mayor.&mdash;Next year the sword was
carried before the mayor for some time, and then before the
bishop as formerly, the mayor following him.</p>
<p>1449.&nbsp; King Henry came to Lynn again, and ordered the
sword to be carried before him. <a name="citation1191"></a><a
href="#footnote1191" class="citation">[1191]</a></p>
<p>1469, or 1470.&nbsp; About this time Edward IV. (put to flight
by the great Earl of Warwick,) came to Lynn out of Lincolnshire;
and in crossing the washes lost his baggage and money, according
to some of our MS. accounts.&mdash;One account says that he
arrived here on Michaelmas Day, 1470, and took shipping here for
Flanders on the 2nd of October; so that his stay was only three
or four days.&nbsp; At that time we are told that he <i>pardoned
Robert Gregory</i>, <i>Coney</i>, <i>and company</i>, who had
probably sided with the house of Lancaster.&nbsp; The Red Mount
is said to be the place at which he then took up his abode; whose
buildings must have been very extensive and capacious, as he is
said to have been attended by a large retinue.&nbsp; It may also
be supposed a place of strength, and the most so of any at Lynn,
or a kind of fortress; for in a place of no other description
would so wary and able a leader choose to trust himself for so
many days and nights together, as he was then circumstanced.</p>
<p>1471.&nbsp; March 9.&nbsp; Edward landed here on his return
from Flanders, in his way to London.</p>
<p>1476.&nbsp; Walter Coney built the roof of the cross aisle of
St. Margaret&rsquo;s church: also the Trinity chapel there, which
has been lately pulled down.</p>
<p>1482.&nbsp; A great law-suit between the town and the bishop
about the right of holding the Court Leet.&nbsp; It does not
appear which party gained the cause.</p>
<p>1493.&nbsp; A great fray between the inhabitants and the under
sheriff of the county.&nbsp; But neither the occasion, not the
result or consequence is mentioned.</p>
<p>1493.&nbsp; King Henry VII. his queen, his mother, and his
eldest son Arthur, with a numerous retinue, visited this town;
and were lodged <a name="page1192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1192</span>and entertained at the Austin Convent, which then
stood behind Mr. Rishton&rsquo;s house, and partly it seems on
the same site.&nbsp; It was doubtless a sumptuous edifice, and
the most suitable for the accommodation of the royal visitors of
any place then in this town.&mdash;see p. 513, &amp;c.</p>
<p>1501.&nbsp; The town-walls new cast, with mortar, broken
glass, and terras.</p>
<p>1502.&nbsp; Thomas Thorisby built the south part of St
Margaret&rsquo;s church, the college, and the south gates.&nbsp;
It was then his third mayoralty.&nbsp; It does not appear at what
time he founded the Grammar School.</p>
<p>1506.&nbsp; The service suspended in St. Margaret&rsquo;s
church, and christenings performed in the Charnel house&mdash;the
occasion not specified, or how the affair terminated.</p>
<p>1510.&nbsp; A suit between this town and Cambridge about the
toll of Stirbitch Fair:&mdash;the precise ground of the dispute
not stated.&nbsp; Nor is it clear who gained the cause.</p>
<p>1512.&nbsp; Parishioners of St. James&rsquo;s rose against the
Prior, for certain wrongs he had done them&mdash;such as cutting
down the trees in the churchyard.</p>
<p>1515.&nbsp; A woman burnt in the Market-place, for the murder
of her husband.</p>
<p>1519.&nbsp; Cardinal Wolsey came to Lynn in great state, and
with a princely retinue of lords, knights, and gentlemen, as was
his usual manner of travelling.</p>
<p>1520.&nbsp; Thomas Miller now became mayor for four years
successively.&nbsp; In the meantime he had a law suit with the
bishop for precedence, or the right of having the sword carried
before him; and is said to have got the cause.&nbsp; A few years
after his lordship lost most of his consequence here, being
obliged by his sovereign to resign his temporal jurisdiction at
Lynn to him, in exchange for the abbey of St. Bennet in Holme: at
which time the name of the town was changed from
<i>Bishop&rsquo;s Lynn</i> to <i>King&rsquo;s Lynn</i>.</p>
<p>1527, (or 1528, according to other accounts) Mary, queen
dowager of France, and sister of Henry VIII, with the duke of
Suffolk, her second husband, came to Lynn, and lodged (as
Mackerell says,) <i>at Mr. Coe&rsquo;s place</i>: but nothing
further is said of Coe&rsquo;s place, or yet of Coe himself.</p>
<p>1531.&nbsp; A maid servant boiled to death in the
market-place, for poisoning her mistress.</p>
<p>1535.&nbsp; A Dutchman burnt in the market-place for reputed
heresy; in other words, for presuming to think for himself, and
acting conscientiously&mdash;which was deemed a crime in former
times, and is so deemed still in some places.</p>
<p><a name="page1193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1193</span>1536.&nbsp; The four great orders of Friars, together
with the other religious orders, were here suppressed, which was
followed by the dissolution of the convents and other religious
houses, which diminished in a great measure the respectable
appearance of the town.</p>
<p>1537.&nbsp; William Gisborough, a friar, was hanged here, and
his father at Walsingham, for attempting to relive their order,
in opposition to the royal decree.&mdash;Two marts or fairs were
also then instituted here, one at the <i>assumption</i>, the
other at the <i>purification</i> of the Blessed Virgin.</p>
<p>1540.&nbsp; The town much afflicted with hot burning agues and
fluxes, on which account there was no mart kept.</p>
<p>1541.&nbsp; The East Gates repaired, and the king&rsquo;s arms
set up there.</p>
<p>1546.&nbsp; The Gilds and Chauntries suppressed, and their
possessions seized by the king:&mdash;His majesty now also
granted his licence for uniting South Lynn to the borough, it
being before unconnected with it, and a separate
jurisdiction.&nbsp; This however seems not to have been brought
to full effect till about ten or eleven years after, in the reign
of Philip and Mary.</p>
<p>1549.&nbsp; St. James&rsquo;s church demolished, (all perhaps
but the cross aisle which still remains; though there is said to
be some further demolition of it in 1623.)&mdash;also what is
called <i>Kett&rsquo;s rebellion</i> now occurred: one body of
the insurgents had a camp at <i>Mousehold heath</i>, by Norwich,
and another body of them had a camp here on <i>Rising
Chase</i>.&nbsp; <i>Lord Willoughby</i> in the meantime was
governor of Lynn, which he secured against all the attempts of
the insurgents to obtain possession of it.</p>
<p>1553.&nbsp; <i>Lord Audley</i> came to Lynn, and proclaimed
<i>Lady Jane Grey</i> queen of England, the mayor and corporation
concurring with him: but Jane&rsquo;s party did not
prevail&mdash;the voice of the nation being decidedly in favour
of Mary.</p>
<p>1554.&nbsp; Trinity Hall underwent considerable alterations;
the council room being divided from the Stone-hall;
&amp;c.&mdash;The South-gates then also covered with lead.</p>
<p>1555.&nbsp; A whale caught near this town&mdash;one account
calls it a <i>small</i> whale, and another calls it an
<i>enormous</i> whale: both describe, it as no less than 40 feet
long.</p>
<p>1556.&nbsp; The pipes taken up, which formerly supplied the
Austin Convent with water from Wootton common.&nbsp; That convent
being dissolved it no longer wanted that supply.&nbsp; But it
shews how well provided it was in its day.</p>
<p>1558.&nbsp; The <i>plague</i> was in the town, and carried off
great numbers of the inhabitants: among them the <i>mayor and
four aldermen</i>&mdash;one account says, the whole five were
mayors successively, in the course of that year; in which case
five mayors must have died here in the course of the year.</p>
<p><a name="page1194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1194</span>1559.&nbsp; Rood-Lofts and Images taken down, the
ground at the east end of the churches levelled with the other
parts, and the windows furnished with <i>glass</i>, instead of
wooden shutters.</p>
<p>1560.&nbsp; Several persons came to Lynn by order of the privy
council, to take the state of St. James&rsquo;s Church, but were
opposed by the corporation: of the strict correctness of which
some doubt may be entertained.</p>
<p>1561.&nbsp; Popish relics and mass-books burnt in the Tuesday
market place.</p>
<p>1562.&nbsp; Sir Nic. Le Strange entered into a law-suit
against Lynn, for the <i>house of Corpus Christi</i>: (the hall,
we suppose, belonging to the late Gild of that name,) but nothing
is said of the ground of the action, or how it terminated.</p>
<p>1564.&nbsp; Marshland inundated, and much stock lost,
especially in Tilney and Terrington.</p>
<p>1566.&nbsp; Chimes first set up in St. Margaret&rsquo;s, which
played a different tune each day of the week.</p>
<p>1567.&nbsp; St. Margaret&rsquo;s Spire, with divers little
crosses and ornaments on different parts of the church, shot down
by a Dutch ship that lay then in the harbour.&nbsp; Which seems
rather a blind and queer kind of a tale.</p>
<p>1568.&nbsp; Popish vestments and relics brought from St.
John&rsquo;s and Tilney, and burnt in the market place.</p>
<p>1569.&nbsp; Marshland drowned, to the great loss and damage of
the inhabitants, many of whom were forced to leave their houses,
and glad to save their lives in boats which came to their
assistance.</p>
<p>1570.&nbsp; Monday and Tuesday, the 2nd. and 3rd. of October,
Marshland and Wiggenhale overflowed with salt water, so that from
Old Lynn to Mawdlin bridge there were not left ten roods of the
bank whole and firm, to the great damage of the whole country,
(see p. 116.)&mdash;Quere, <i>If this flood and the preceding
were not the same</i>: <i>some careless writer of memoranda
antedating it under</i> 1569?&mdash;another account seems to have
post-dated it under 1570.</p>
<p>1574 or 1575.&nbsp; Earthquake and plague in this town.&nbsp;
Also in the latter year <i>Henry Wodehouse</i>, vice admiral of
Norfolk, seized two fly-boats here by process, which the mayor
refused to serve, and thereby brought great trouble on himself
and several others.&mdash;In one MS. the admiral is called <i>Sir
Thomas Wodehouse</i>.</p>
<p>1576.&nbsp; Commissioners of Sewers cut off the water from
Sechy river, which worked the town mill, which caused great loss;
no less than 1000 marks having been laid out to bring the water
hither.</p>
<p>The Queen about this time coming into Norfolk, was presented
by our corporation with a rich purse, finely wrought and adorned
with <a name="page1195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1195</span>pearl and gold, containing 100 old angels of gold: the
whole valued at 200<i>l.</i></p>
<p>1579.&nbsp; The town-ditches from the South-gate to
Kettle-mills scoured, and the walls also repaired and cast with
black mortar.</p>
<p>1581.&nbsp; That part of St. James&rsquo;s church that had not
been demolished repaired, and fitted up for a workhouse, to
employ the poor in the manufacture of Bays; which not found to
answer the cost, was afterwards given up.&mdash;St.
Nicholas&rsquo; also was then repaired at considerable
expense.</p>
<p>1582.&nbsp; Ringing having been here for some time disused,
certain young fellows, attempting to revive it, were opposed by
divers of the aldermen, which occasioned no small disturbance and
the spending of a great deal of money.&nbsp; But it is not said
in what way it was spent, or how the affair ended.</p>
<p>1583.&nbsp; Gaywood river new cast, from the Kettle-mills to
the Purfleet bridge.</p>
<p>1584.&nbsp; Lynn again visited by the Plague; on which account
the <i>mart</i> was <i>removed from Damgate to the Tuesday
market-place</i>; where it has been kept ever since.</p>
<p>1585.&nbsp; The stone-bridge (High Bridge) taken down, and two
arches of brick added to it.&nbsp; The drain in Webster&rsquo;s
row, (Broad Street) also vaulted over with brick.</p>
<p>1586.&nbsp; The manufacture of Bays having failed, divers poor
people were now employed at the Work-house in dressing hemp and
making strings and tows for the fishermen.</p>
<p>The stone bridge, or High Bridge, was now also new built: that
is, as we presume, the houses on each side, which had been pulled
down: for the new arches had been built the year before.</p>
<p>1587.&nbsp; The pinnacle or top part of St. James&rsquo;s
steeple taken down, and the remaining part made flat and covered
with tiles.&mdash;<i>Sir Robert Southwell</i>, admiral of
Norfolk, with several commissioners and justices held a court of
admiralty at Lynn, at which sixteen <i>pirates</i> were
condemned, most of whom were executed at <i>Gannock</i>.</p>
<p>This year also <i>John Wanker&rsquo;s wife</i> and the
<i>widow Porker</i>, were both <i>carted</i> here for
<i>whoredom</i>, a crime which appears to have been then greatly
discountenanced in this town; so that those found guilty of it
were put in a cart, or fastened to its tail, and driven or dawn,
through the whole town, as spectacles of detestation.&nbsp; The
business is now managed differently.</p>
<p>1588.&nbsp; The memorable <i>Feast of Reconciliation</i>,
which far excelled all our other Lynn Feasts, was this year
instituted.&nbsp; It was a meeting of the mayor, some of the
aldermen, common council-men, and the clergy, held the first
Monday in the month, to check discord, reconcile differences, <a
name="page1196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1196</span>and
decide all manner of controversies among the inhabitants.&nbsp;
It was well calculated to do good, and did much good, no doubt,
while it was duly attended to; but is become now as a tale that
is told, and seems like other feasts to be now fast passing
towards oblivion.&mdash;This year Lynn is also said to have
furnished a pinnace to oppose the dreaded Spanish Armada.</p>
<p>1589.&nbsp; Five sail of ships from this town formed part of
the squadron of Drake and Norris in their expedition against
Spain; and it is said they returned home safe without any
loss.</p>
<p>1590.&nbsp; One <i>Margaret Read</i> burnt here for
<i>Witchcraft</i>&mdash;a reputed crime deemed in those days as
atrocious as murder, if not much more so.&nbsp; The history of
Lynn is sadly stained and disgraced with accounts of these
executions, or rather legal murders committed by the
magistrates.&mdash;The same year the foundation of the South-gate
was secured from the danger of being undermined by water.</p>
<p>1594.&nbsp; A violent storm or tempest, which began September
the twenty-first and lasted till the twenty-fourth.</p>
<p>1596.&nbsp; A new wind-mill erected at
Gannock&mdash;occasioned probably by the difficulty of obtaining
a sufficient supply of water to work the town water-mill.</p>
<p>1597.&nbsp; The great Mill-dyke from Sayer&rsquo;s Marsh new
cast.&nbsp; But the Mill afterwards seems to have been in general
but ill supplied with water.&nbsp; It was at last given up, after
having been the grist mill of the town time immemorial.&nbsp; It
stood by the Lancastrian school and new bridge.&nbsp; The lane
below took from it the name of <i>Mill-lane</i>.&mdash;Great
sickness and mortality in the town this year; particularly from
March to July, when 320 persons are said to have been buried in
St. James&rsquo;s church yard.&mdash;Other accounts place this
mortality in the following year.</p>
<p>1598.&nbsp; One <i>Elizabeth Housegoe</i> executed for
<i>Witchcraft</i>.&mdash;Another legal, but most foul murder
committed by Lynn magistrates.&mdash;One MS. mentions two men of
war, as fitted out this year, at the expense of this town and
Yarmouth.</p>
<p>1602.&nbsp; A severe shock of an Earthquake felt here on
Christmas Eve.&mdash;also the Windmill removed from the South
gates to Kettle-mills: but not by the earthquake, we suppose.</p>
<p>1604.&nbsp; A man executed for a rape, on a child under ten
years of age.</p>
<p>1605.&nbsp; King James&rsquo;s Charter was this year obtained,
which greatly augmented the privileges of the corporation;
particularly in exempting them from the jurisdiction of the Lord
High Admiral, and investing the mayor and burgesses with that
power within this borough and its liberties.&nbsp; This Charter
is long and its grants most ample.</p>
<p>The town-clerk, <i>Vallenger</i>, also this year built the
South Lynn Almshouses, for four poor men. (see p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page1133">1133</a></span>, <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page1160">1160</a></span>, and
<span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page1185">1185</a></span>.)&nbsp; A <a
name="page1197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1197</span>great
fire broke out in High street, in which a man and his wife and
family perished.&nbsp; The Cistern at Kettle mills was made.</p>
<p>1606.&nbsp; A vessel of one hundred tons overthrown in this
haven, in February, and not recovered till April.</p>
<p>1607.&nbsp; A very high tide, which flowed up quite to the
Tuesday market-cross.</p>
<p>1616.&nbsp; One <i>Mary Smith</i> executed here for
<i>Witchcraft</i> on the twelfth of January:&mdash;one account
says that she was <i>burnt</i>, and another that she was
<i>hanged</i>; but all may safely say she was
<i>murdered</i>.&nbsp; Alexander Roberts, one of the Lynn clergy,
is said to have given an account of her execution, in a treatise
he published that year on Witchcraft.</p>
<p>1617.&nbsp; St. Nicholas&rsquo;s Library founded by the mayor
and burgesses.&mdash;One Dr. Pearse gave 1000<i>l.</i> to the
corporation, they to pay for it 5 per cent. interest; but they
disclaimed and would not accept it. (see Joseph Cooper&rsquo;s
book, and Hall books No. 7,)&mdash;It is not said how the
interest was to be applied.</p>
<p>1620.&nbsp; Two large fishes cast here on shore, one thirty
feet long, and the other eighteen yards; but Mackerell is loath
to believe the latter to be so large, and thinks it could be only
eighteen feet.&mdash;The old custom-house now pulled down and
rebuilt.&mdash;eight or nine ships driven up to St. Germans, and
several sunk at the Ball, so as not to be seen at low water or
dead neap. (J. Cooper&rsquo;s MS.)</p>
<p>1621.&nbsp; A man drawn up by the rope of St. Margaret&rsquo;s
great bell and killed.&mdash;The people prohibited going to
Gaywood Fair; but the reason not told.</p>
<p>1623.&nbsp; St. James&rsquo;s church underwent additional
demolition: one account says, that it was now
&ldquo;<i>entirety</i> pulled down,&rdquo; which must be a
mistake, as the cross aisle is still standing, and forms a
principal part of the present workhouse.</p>
<p>1626.&nbsp; St. Ann&rsquo;s Fort erected, and furnished with a
number of great guns from the Tower.&nbsp; The house adjoining,
and the piazza, or covered walk, supposed to have been erected
about the same time.</p>
<p>1628.&nbsp; Chimes said to be now <i>first</i> set up in St.
Margaret&rsquo;s: but it seems to be a mistake, as we had heard
of chimes there many years before, (see under 1566.)&nbsp; Chimes
are also said to be now first set up at St.
Nicholas&rsquo;s.&mdash;On the 20th. December this year, the four
varlets, or sergeants at mace being absent from the mayor, his
worship caused them to be cried in different parts of the
town:&mdash;what success attended this curious experiment, or
whether his worship ever found his lost or strayed sergeants,
does not appear.</p>
<p>1629.&nbsp; The Bedehouse repaired, and a pipe laid to it
conveying thither St. Margaret&rsquo;s water.&mdash;Writing
school established in the chamber over the Butcher&rsquo;s
shambles, in Saturday market.&mdash;Those shambles <a
name="page1198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1198</span>furnished
with a weighing stool to weigh children.&nbsp; But it seems an
odd idea, to have children taken to the butcher&rsquo;s shambles,
to be weighed like hogs or sheep.</p>
<p>1630.&nbsp; April 29.&nbsp; The White Friars steeple, or tower
of the Carmelite Convent in South Lynn, fell with a tremendous
crash.&mdash;Draining of Paradise now took place, which seems to
have been before in a hoggish state&mdash;The great muck-hill, at
the East-gate, spread over St. Catharine&rsquo;s ground, close
by.&mdash;One Beane, a tailor, indicted for ravishing his maid,
but got off, on paying a fine of 50<i>l.</i></p>
<p>1631.&nbsp; A high tide, overflowing the lands about the town,
deprived it of fresh water for a long time.</p>
<p>1633.&nbsp; The Ferry-boat sunk, by which eighteen persons
were drowned.</p>
<p>1634.&nbsp; The mayor, Thomas Gurling, buried his wife, and
married another the next week.</p>
<p>1635.&nbsp; Five lads, who were here at school, going to wash
in the river, near the Ball, were there drowned.</p>
<p>1636.&nbsp; The Plague again in this town; on which account
sheds or pest-houses were erected under the town walls for the
diseased, where about 200 persons are said to have
died.&mdash;Also 4th. November, a terrible storm here; fourteen
sail of ships lost in the harbour, and all hands perished,
according to one account.</p>
<p>1637.&nbsp; An order arrived from the archbishop, for the
ground at the East end of the churches to be raised, railed in,
with steps to ascend thither, and the communion tables, or alters
to be there placed.&nbsp; This was one of <i>Laud&rsquo;s</i>
high-church projects, and one of those that increased the public
discontents, and hastened his and his sovereign&rsquo;s
downfal.&mdash;The town this year assessed 200<i>l.</i> towards
building a ship of war.&mdash;[Three years before, the town,
according to one account, was also assessed 1192<i>l.</i> towards
building a ship of war, of 800 tons, and 260 men.]&nbsp; Twelve
Grampuses here cast on shore, seventeen, eighteen, and nineteen
feet long.</p>
<p>1638.&nbsp; The town store of gunpowder lodged in the Red
Mount.&nbsp; Two weekly foot-posts appointed for London: to go by
turns, and have 30<i>s.</i> a year for their wages.&mdash;The
water-rent of a Brewhouse and Malthouse fixed at 5<i>l.</i> a
year, and of a Brew-house only at 3<i>l.</i></p>
<p>1639.&nbsp; Thomas Toll, mayor elect, being very ill on
Michaelmas day, had the oaths administered to him in bed, at his
own house.</p>
<p>1640.&nbsp; March 13.&nbsp; The sheriff&rsquo;s precept
arrived for the election of two members for this borough, to
serve in the parliament summoned to meet at Westminster on the
15th of the following month; when Messrs. Doughty and Gurlyn, the
two senior aldermen, were chosen, with an allowance of <i>five
shilling a day</i> while they attended their duty in the
senate.&mdash;12 October about 3 weeks before the meeting of the
Long <a name="page1199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1199</span>Parliament, the mayor, <i>William Doughty</i>,
apprised the Hall of two Letters just received from the <i>Earl
of Arundell</i>, one to the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses, the
other to the mayor himself, to induce them to return certain
persons of his nominating and recommending to the said
parliament.&nbsp; On which it was unanimously agreed and
resolved, not to choose any other burgesses to serve in
parliament but such as are resident and inhabitants within the
corporation or borough.&nbsp; Messrs. <i>Thomas Toll</i> and
<i>John Percivall</i>, two of the alderman, were accordingly
chosen as representatives of Lynn, in that memorable parliament:
and they were the first ever elected here by the voice of the
<i>freemen of large</i>&mdash;the <i>Hall only</i>, or some part
of it, being till now the only and sole electors of our
parliamentary representatives.&nbsp; [Some, perhaps will be ready
to say, that the case is not much otherwise, even at
present.]</p>
<p>1641.&nbsp; A sword-fish of an uncommon size came up to the
town and was taken.&nbsp; The town now also began to be
fortified, and seven pieces of brass ordnance or cannon were sent
hither from London.&nbsp; Everything, in short, both here and
throughout the kingdom, was fast advancing towards the great
crisis which the nation soon after experienced.&nbsp; [How much
that period resembled the present, may deserve some
consideration.]</p>
<p>1642.&nbsp; The three gates (the East, the South, and
Gannock,) furnished with draw-bridges.&mdash;Captain
<i>Sherwood</i>, of Norwich, with a troop of dragoons appeared
before the town, and came close under St. Catharine&rsquo;s wall
by the East Gate, demanding entrance, which the mayor and
townsmen refused: the gate being shut; and bridge drawn.&nbsp;
The Earl of Manchester soon after appeared with a strong force,
and commenced the siege of the town on the 28th of August, and on
the 16th of the following month the town surrendered to him, with
the loss of only <i>four</i> men killed, and a few wounded.&nbsp;
According to the terms of capitulation every foot soldier of his
had 10<i>s.</i> paid him, and every foot officer a
fortnight&rsquo;s pay; which, according to Mackerell, amounted to
3200<i>l.</i>&mdash;We are told that our principal Lynn
commanders or warriors on this occasion were Sir Horace
Townshend, Captain Kirby, Capt. Atkin, Capt. Morse, Capt.
Gurling, Capt. Wharton, Capt. Brady, Capt. Davy, Capt. Marsh, and
Lieut. Porter:&mdash;all very loyal and royal, no doubt, but
ingloriously conquered by their jacobinic and democratic
assailants.&nbsp; During this memorable siege, in the afternoon
of Sunday, September 3, an eighteen-pounder from a battery on the
west side of the river entered St. Margaret&rsquo;s church at the
west window in sermon-time, took off a great part of one of the
pillars, and terribly frightened the whole congregation, but no
body was materially hurt&mdash;all left the church in the utmost
terror and confusion.&nbsp; <a name="page1200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1200</span>[<i>Of these matters</i>, <i>and
subsequent proceedings and regulations here</i>, <i>see Part</i>
IV. <i>Chap.</i> IV. p. 754, &amp;c.]</p>
<p>October 9. same year (1642) there was an order of the Hall,
(or of the new constituted authorities,) that the <i>Charters</i>
should be <i>read</i> by the Town-Clerk, in <i>English</i>,
&ldquo;that those of that body might the <i>better understand
what then were sworn to maintain</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;We cannot
discover that any thing of the kind was ever thought of here, but
at this time of republican predominance: at all other times the
members of the Hall, as well as the freemen at large, were called
upon to swear to maintain certain unknown rights&mdash;a
something they knew not what.&mdash;Nineteen out of twenty,
perhaps, of our present freemen have been thus solemnly sworn,
which must render those freemen the most disreputable and
contemptible part of our whole population: for what can degrade
any man more than to submit to swear what he does not
understand?</p>
<p>1643.&nbsp; January 2.&nbsp; Parliament ordered that the
mayor, aldermen, and common council of Lynn, should pay and allow
their two representatives, out of the town stock, as large an
allowance per diem as they had used to pay any of their aldermen
that had represented that town in parliament.&mdash;The
corporation would fain have evaded this expense&mdash;partly on
the plea, that the <i>whole body of freemen</i> had a voice in
the election of these two members, and <i>not the Hall alone</i>,
as usual; and therefore that this payment should not rest solely
on the latter.&nbsp; But their chief plea was poverty, and having
no town stock.&nbsp; It was however not admitted, and our
corporation at last agreed to pay their two representatives
5<i>s.</i> a day during their attendance in parliament.</p>
<p>March 20.&nbsp; <i>Oliver Cromwell</i> (then called <i>Col.
Cromwell</i>) visited this town, and was entertained here at the
expense of the corporation. <a name="citation1200"></a><a
href="#footnote1200" class="citation">[1200]</a>&mdash;The
curious painted glass, in the windows of St. Margaret&rsquo;s
church, taken down this year, and replaced with plain glass.</p>
<p>1644.&nbsp; Ships coming hither from places infected with the
plague obliged to observe quarantine fourteen days, one half in
the roads and the other in White Friar&rsquo;s
Fleet&mdash;<i>Col. Valentine Wauton</i> was now governor, and
<i>Miles Corbet</i> recorder of Lynn&mdash;both of whom sat
afterwards as judges at the king&rsquo;s trial, and finally
suffered among the condemned regicides.</p>
<p>1645.&nbsp; In February <i>Sir Thomas Fairfax</i> visited
Lynn, and was entertained at the expense of the
corporation.&mdash;<i>Dorothy Lee</i> and <i>Grace Wright</i>
were also murdered here legally by the magistrates; or, in other
words, <i>hanged for witchcraft</i>.&mdash;The plague visited the
town again this <a name="page1201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1201</span>year.&mdash;<i>Col. Hobart</i> became now governor,
and <i>Guybon Goddard</i> deputy recorder of Lynn.</p>
<p>1646.&nbsp; The eleventh of May this year was rendered not a
little conspicuous among our memorable days, by a most curious
resolution of the Hall, expressed as follows in our volume of
extracts&mdash;&ldquo;It is this day ordered that alderman Th.
Rivett be requested to send for Mr. <i>Hopkins</i> the
<i>Witch-Discoverer</i> to come to Lynn, and his charges and
recompense to be borne by the town.&rdquo;&mdash;This year also
the charge of the Town Records was committed to one <i>Ticket
Browne</i>, who had been turned out for erasing and falsifying
them, thirteen years before.&mdash;The town having suffered much
by means of <i>Lord Paulet</i>, parliament ordered reparation to
be made out of his estate.&mdash;see p. 761.</p>
<p>1648.&nbsp; A woman was hanged here, for killing her child:
Her name supposed to be <i>Rose Warne</i>, of whose penitent
death Mr. Horn, then vicar of South Lynn, published an
account.&mdash;The ruinous state of the town being now
represented to parliament, they voted &ldquo;2000 oaks for
reparation thereof.&rdquo; see p. 761.</p>
<p>1649.&nbsp; Lease of three Ferry-rights granted to John Bird,
at 10<i>l.</i> per annum, and a <i>brace of well-fatted Swans to
the mayor</i>.</p>
<p>1650.&nbsp; An insurrection of royalists now took place in
this county, and the Lynn garrison employed in its
suppression.&mdash;One <i>Major Saul</i> was then taken and
hanged here in the Tuesday Market-place, see p.
769.&mdash;<i>Dorothy Floyd</i> (or <i>Lloyd</i>,) murdered by
our magistrates: (that is, <i>hanged for
witchcraft</i>:)&mdash;one of the blessed effects, we may
suppose, of Hopkins the witchfinder&rsquo;s late
visit.&mdash;October 16.&nbsp; Shops ordered to be shut up every
Thursday during Lecture-time, to the end that people and their
servants might attend the hearing the word of God&mdash;<i>This
order was issued by the very people who had sent for the
witchfinder</i>; so that we cannot attach much merit to it.</p>
<p>1651.&nbsp; Lynn petitioned parliament against the erection of
Denver Sluice, which was probably no injudicious step.</p>
<p>1652.&nbsp; The Lynn garrison dissolved.</p>
<p>1653.&nbsp; One <i>Say</i> hanged here for <i>killing her
husband</i>&mdash;one account says it was by
<i>poison</i>.&mdash;The South gate was now let to Henry Bloy at
1<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> a year, and the East gate to James Browne
at 1<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> which shews that the town had then more
intercourse with the country by the <i>East</i> than by the
<i>South gate</i>.&mdash;There being before this year only
<i>six</i> corn meters, but they were now increased to
<i>ten</i>.</p>
<p>1654.&nbsp; The town obtained a very advantageous charter from
the Protector, of which we have not been able to get sight of any
copy or transcript.&nbsp; It was probably destroyed at the
restoration.</p>
<p>1655.&nbsp; Lynn now again garrisoned.</p>
<p><a name="page1202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1202</span>1656.&nbsp; The generals Rippon and Desborow elected
members for this town, and their charges (we suppose 5<i>s.</i>
per diem) ordered to be paid by the corporation.&mdash;St.
George&rsquo;s Hall now converted into an <i>Exchange</i>.</p>
<p>1657.&nbsp; Front of the Free-School-Master&rsquo;s house
rebuilt at the charge of the corporation&mdash;Rent of the two
gates advanced from 1<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> and 1<i>l.</i>
15<i>s.</i> to 15<i>l.</i> a year, which seems to indicate the
thriving state of the town during the protectorate.&mdash;During
this and some of the preceding years, a mighty stir was made here
for the suppression of vice, and especially of <i>profane
swearing</i>, <i>excessive drinking</i>, and <i>tippling</i>,
which greatly affected the publicans, or ale-house-keepers, who
were then very heavily fined, which occasioned great discontents
and complaints on their part and that of their
customers.&mdash;The money thus raised said to be applied towards
paving and improving the town.&nbsp; Of that stir see pp. 773,
&amp;c.&mdash;The mayor now agreed to take <i>forty shillings</i>
instead of two fatted swans from the Ferry-man.</p>
<p>1658.&nbsp; St. James&rsquo;s church yard became the parish
being-ground, there being no longer any room left for burying in
St. Margaret&rsquo;s churchyard.&mdash;One <i>Dorothy Warden</i>,
alias <i>Billins</i> hanged for killing her
child.&mdash;<i>Oliver</i> died, and was succeeded in the
Protectorate by his son <i>Richard</i>, to whom an <i>Address</i>
was voted by this corporation on the 8th of October.</p>
<p>1659.&nbsp; Jan. 3.&nbsp; The right of electing burgesses or
members of parliament determined to be in the <i>Hall</i>, and
<i>not in the freemen at large</i>: the two members, <i>Toll</i>
and <i>Lloyd</i> were accordingly now elected by the
Hall.&mdash;Jan. 14.&nbsp; Ordered that the chamberlain take of
all townsmen who build Booths at the Mart, 6<i>d.</i> and of
strangers 10<i>d.</i> a foot for their ground.</p>
<p>1660.&nbsp; April 13.&nbsp; The freemen at large claiming
again, rather clamorously, a voice at the election of burgesses,
the Hall thought proper to give way; <i>Hare</i> and
<i>Walpole</i> were accordingly elected by the freemen at
large.&mdash;May 29, 300 Young maids, dressed all in white, (200
of them at the expense of two wealthy individuals,) paraded
through the principal streets, by way of joy and triumph for the
king&rsquo;s restoration, see p. <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page797">797</a></span>.&mdash;Divine service now
performed at St. Margaret&rsquo;s, in summer at 5, and in winter
at 6 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, which had not been the case
for the last ten years.</p>
<p>1661.&nbsp; Alderman Keeling expelled the Hall for
<i>non-residence</i>.&mdash;Rent of South-gate tolls lowered from
15<i>l.</i> to 5<i>l.</i> a year.</p>
<p>1662.&nbsp; An impost of 1<i>s.</i> per chalder laid on all
coals brought by strangers, and applied to the relief of the
Poor, who were here then very numerous and much distressed,
notwithstanding, the blessed restoration.</p>
<p>1663.&nbsp; Several Friends or <i>Quakers</i> were now also
imprisoned here for nonconformity, which shews how friendly the
restoration proved to liberty of conscience.&mdash;&ldquo;Many
musters and shews (says Mackerell,) were performed by the
<i>Trained Bands</i>, who took the oaths of allegiance and <a
name="page1203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1203</span>supremacy
to the king with all imaginable chearfulness.&rdquo;&mdash;Tolls
of the East gate let for one year at 11<i>l.</i></p>
<p>1664.&nbsp; Price of coals advanced this year from 17<i>s.</i>
to 30<i>s.</i> and upwards.&mdash;Lord <i>Townshend</i> elected
<i>lord high steward</i>.</p>
<p>1665.&nbsp; The plague again this year visited Lynn and
committed great ravages; on which account the gates were shut and
even the mackerell carts not suffered to enter.</p>
<p>1666.&nbsp; Plague continued and no Mart kept&mdash;markets
also discontinued, and all communication with the country
suspended.</p>
<p>1667.&nbsp; A woman, named Wharton, hanged for killing her
child.</p>
<p>1670.&nbsp; Duke of Richmond and lord Townshend entertained
here at the expense of the Hall&mdash;great fear here of a
Quo-warranto for issuing farthing tokens&mdash;<i>Worsted
Weavers</i> petition parliament to have a Dyer and Calender
settled here.&mdash;Proclamation relating to decayed houses: [to
be seized by the corporation unless timely repaired.]</p>
<p>1671.&nbsp; August 11.&nbsp; Sir Robert Steward apprizes the
corporation of the king&rsquo;s intention to visit Lynn in the
course of the following month: 100<i>l.</i> is therefore ordered
to be paid into the Chamberlain&rsquo;s hands to provide for that
occasion.&nbsp; Provision was accordingly made, but his said
majesty did not come.&nbsp; Nov. 10.&nbsp; The whole banquet
provided for the king, voted to the mayor for the sum of
10<i>l.</i></p>
<p>1672.&nbsp; Address to his majesty acknowledging his grace and
favour in pardoning the corporation for coining
farthings.&mdash;<i>Duke of Ormond</i>, &amp;c. entertained here
at the expense of the Hall.</p>
<p>1673.&nbsp; Giles Alden, common council-man expelled the Hall
for non-residence or frequent absence.</p>
<p>1676.&nbsp; William Pearson hanged here for shop
lifting.&mdash;Mr. <i>Helcote</i> laid the foundation of
<i>Broad-street Almshouse</i>, which was next year completed by
<i>Framingham</i>.</p>
<p>1677.&nbsp; One <i>John Swift</i>, a shop-breaker, hanged.</p>
<p>1678.&nbsp; Application made by the Hall to Thomas Goddard
Esq. son of the late Recorder, Guybon Goddard, for his
father&rsquo;s MS. Collections relating to the antiquities of
this town&mdash;but it is supposed without success:&mdash;20
guineas however were offered for them.&mdash;The elder
<i>Turner</i> began now to acquire consequence here, being, as
Mackerell says, common council-man, mayor-elect, parliament-man,
and captain of the Trained Bands, all in the space of two
years.</p>
<p>1679.&nbsp; The corporation signified their intention, not to
have any in future to represent the town, in parliament, but some
two of their own townsmen.&mdash;<i>Wm. Basset</i>, <i>M.D.</i>
resigned his aldermanship; deeming its duties incompatible with
those of his medical profession.&nbsp; [What would he have
thought had he gone <i>out of town</i> to live?]&mdash;One
<i>John </i><a name="page1204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1204</span><i>Page</i>, an old offender, was hanged here this
year: one account says, it was for breaking open several
shops.</p>
<p>On the 3rd of July this year, there was a <i>great fire at
Market-Dereham</i>, which burnt a great part of that town, and
reduced the sufferers to great distress; which Lynn affected
deeply to commiserate, and a collection was made here for them,
amounting in all, if we are not mistaken, to 110<i>l.</i> but it
ought surely to have been more, considering the state of the
case, and that the aldermen went about to collect through their
different wards:&mdash;(which appears from the book of Extracts
so often referred to)</p>
<p>1680.&nbsp; Sir Henry Hobart and Sir Taylor returned burgesses
for this town.&mdash;A grampus was taken 22 feet long and 7 feet
deep.&mdash;Mackerell says, that St James&rsquo;s church began
now to be made a spinning-school for the collectioner&rsquo;s
children; but we know not what he meant by
<i>Collectioner</i>.</p>
<p>1681.&nbsp; The mart this year kept in Common Stath
yard.&nbsp; Nov. 4. a committee appointed to report if the said
yard was convenient for keeping the mart there in
future&mdash;[it probably did not appear to them a convenient
place for that purpose, so that the mart was kept there but one
year.]</p>
<p>1682.&nbsp; The mayor, with several aldermen and common
council-men met the king at Newmarket, and there presented an
Address to him.&mdash;A committee this year appointed for
erecting a public workhouse: accordingly we find that St.
James&rsquo;s church was now fitted up for that
purpose.&mdash;Two new <i>May-poles</i> were also this year set
up in the town; one in the Market place and the other at the
Fort.</p>
<p>1683.&nbsp; Lord Mowbray, Earl of Arundell, Lord Lieutenant of
the county, entertained at the public charge.&mdash;The governor
and guardians of the workhouse incorporated, under the dignified
names of <i>Master and Brethren of St. James&rsquo;s
Hospital</i>.</p>
<p>1684.&nbsp; The Earl of Arundell, Lord Lieutenant of the
County, and now Duke of Norfolk, again entertained here at the
public charge.&mdash;New altar-piece set up at the church, which
cost near 200<i>l.</i>&mdash;Our Charters were now also
surrendered to the king, who on that occasion conferred on the
two aldermen, <i>Turner</i> and <i>Taylor</i>, the honour and
dignity of <i>knighthood</i>.&mdash;On the 18th. of August this
year it was ordered at the Hall, that every new-elected alderman,
in lieu of the customary treat, should pay 10<i>l.</i> and a
common-council-man 20 nobles, for the benefit of the new
work-house; which was continued above 40 years.&mdash;(see under
1725)&mdash;None now admitted to their freedom unless they had
taken the sacrament within the preceding year.</p>
<p>1685.&nbsp; Febr. 10. James the second proclaimed, and an
address to him agreed upon, four days after&mdash;Nov. 9.&nbsp;
The <i>may-pole</i> in the market place taken down to be replaced
by the <i>king&rsquo;s statue</i>.&mdash;The two <a

<i>Turner</i> and <i>Taylor</i> elected members for the
town.&mdash;Petition transmitted and recommended to them
concerning <i>the decay of the stocking trade</i> here by the
introduction of <i>weaving</i>, instead of <i>knitting</i>.&nbsp;
See more about it under 1690.</p>
<p>1686.&nbsp; April 13.&nbsp; The anniversary of their majesties
coronation kept here with no small pomp and parade; and the
king&rsquo;s statue set up at the same time with extravagant
rejoicings, in the market place, where the may-pole had formerly
stood.</p>
<p>1687.&nbsp; This town presented a very loyal address to his
majesty, agreed upon 19th. September.&mdash;In November Lord
Cornbury and others visited Lyon and were entertained at the
public charge.</p>
<p>1688.&nbsp; Sunday 29th. of January being appointed a day of
Thanksgiving for the queen&rsquo;s pregnancy, was kept here with
wonderful solemnity: the mayor and whole corporation, in their
formalities, attended at morning and evening service, <i>to
render thanks to Almighty God for so signal a blessing</i>; and
after evening service they repaired to the custom-house to drink
the king&rsquo;s health with a bonefire.</p>
<p>29th. of June another thanksgiving day was kept here, for the
queen&rsquo;s delivery and birth of the prince.&mdash;The king
was also now loyally addressed.&mdash;Such was the loyalty and
piety of our ancestors in the reign of James the
second.&mdash;His majesty after seizing the charters, and
removing several members of the Hall, and replacing them with
others whom he thought better of, had his pious projects, and
paternal plans and purposes suddenly interrupted and frustrated,
by the arrival of the Prince of Orange on the 5th. of
November&mdash;which brought on the <i>Revolution</i>.</p>
<p>1689.&nbsp; The convention parliament, having met on the 22d.
of January, declared the throne <i>abdicated</i>, and offered the
same to the prince and princess of Orange, which they soon agreed
to accept; and they were crowned on the 8th. of April.&mdash;On
the 27th. of September the Fort guns at St. Ann&rsquo;s, which
had been removed to Hull, were returned, and placed in their
former situation.</p>
<p>1690.&nbsp; In our extracts from the Hall books, the following
passage occurs, under the date of Jan. 17th.&mdash;&ldquo;On
Petition of the Hosiers of this town in behalf of the poor,
against the new invention of <i>weaving</i> worstead hose,
whereby many thousands of poor are destitute of employment.&nbsp;
It is this day ordered and agreed that a Petition from this house
(the <i>Hall</i>,) to the honourable House of Commons,
representing that grievance, now read, to be sealed with the
common seal of this Burgh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aug. 29.&nbsp; Henry Framingham, now chosen mayor, remitted
the usual fee of 100<i>l.</i>&nbsp; In other respects he was an
unfeeling, intolerant being, as appears by the shameful
persecution that was carried on here during his mayoralty, and
that of his immediate successor, against one of the dissenting
ministers and his congregations&mdash;see p. <span

<p>1694.&nbsp; Great inconvenience having arisen of late from
large ships occupying Dowshill, Purfleet, Mill, and Whitefriars
Fleets, to the exclusion of Keels, Barges, Boats, Lighters and
other open vessels, whereby many of the latter, left exposed to
the violence of the flood and ebb tides were damaged or
lost.&mdash;the mayor, aldermen, and common council, on the 29th.
of January this year, ordered that no person thenceforth do lay,
or suffer to be laid, any vessel of the burden of 20 tons or
upwards, in any of those Fleets, otherwise than ancient and
accustomed ship seats, &amp;c. under the penalty of 3<i>s.</i>
4<i>d.</i> for every tide they did as offend&mdash;the mayor
reserving the power of permission on extraordinary
occasions.&mdash;4th. June, Meter&rsquo;s pay fixed at <i>one
penny</i> each chalder of coals of <i>freemen</i>, and <i>two
pence</i> of <i>strangers</i>; and on tonnage goods, a pence a
ton of freemen, and 4 pence of strangers.</p>
<p>1695.&nbsp; March 11.&nbsp; The Hall signed an address to his
majesty, in the feature of an association, to stand by and assist
him against all his enemies.</p>
<p>1696.&nbsp; Outgoings or expences in maintaining the
water-works for the last ten years exceeded the income by
288<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&mdash;The expenditure being
1427<i>l.</i> 7<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> and income 1338<i>l.</i>
14<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i></p>
<p>200 sail of Colliers and coasters, in running for Lynn deeps
in a storm, were all wrecked, and near 1000 persons
perished.&nbsp; (Norfolk Remem.)&nbsp; Scarcity of coals, and
price greatly advanced.</p>
<p>1697.&nbsp; The Hall gained a cause in a trial with Leonard
Hutton, before Lord Chief Justice <i>Holt</i>.&mdash;They also
petition parliament for the removal of the dam and sluice near
Salter&rsquo;s Load, and preserving of navigation.&mdash;The
<i>Bagges</i>, <i>Brownes</i>, and <i>Scarlets</i>, now begin to
make some figure here.</p>
<p>1698.&nbsp; Pictures of Edward VI. and James I. presented to
the Hall by alderman Robinson.&mdash;Juggard succeeds Haslewood
as Lecturer.</p>
<p>1699.&nbsp; <i>John Cary</i> succeeds, <i>Osborne</i> as
writing master, and is to teach 6 poor boys gratis, and to
instruct all the children in the Church Catechism.&mdash;This is
the first prominence of the Carys.&mdash;A ship now sent to
Norway for pump-wood, or timber for water-pipes, at the adventure
and charge of the mayor and burgesses.</p>
<p>1709.&nbsp; Another ship freighted to Norway for pump-wood for
the water-works.</p>
<p>1701.&nbsp; The Head Porters and Meters being convicted of
bribery and defrauding the king of his dues, were all discharged;
but about a month <a name="page1207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1207</span>after some of them were restored, by giving bond with
one security in 20<i>l.</i>&mdash;August 29. the elder Pyle

and clergymen exempted from tolls here.</p>
<p>1702.&nbsp; Dr. Little succeeds Mr. Fysh as minister of St.
Margaret&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>1703.&nbsp; Sept. 24. The Boale, or World&rsquo;s End, with
the houses thereon, and the rights and duties attached to the
same, bought of Robert Elsden, by the corporation, for
130<i>l.</i> and 20<i>l.</i> more at the end of five years from
that date, (see p. <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page873">873</a></span>)&mdash;Towards the latter end of
November this year, happened that dreadful national calamity
commonly distinguished by the name of <i>the great storm</i>, of
whose effects here, see p. <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page874">874</a></span>.</p>
<p>1704.&nbsp; The gloom of the former year succeeded and
dissipated by the triumphs of Marlborough at <i>Blenheim</i>,
which occasioned great rejoicings throughout the kingdom, of
which Lynn largely participated, as appears by its address to the
throne, see p. <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page874">874</a></span>.</p>
<p>1705.&nbsp; The gentlemen of the counties of Bedford and
Huntingdon prefer a serious charge of arbitrary and exorbitant
exactions, or extortion against this corporation, see p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page879">879</a></span>.</p>
<p>1708.&nbsp; Lynn harbour said to be now in a most wretched and
alarming state, see <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page888">888</a></span>.&mdash;In the course of this year
also, according to one of our MS. accounts, two children were
hanged here for felony, one eleven, and the other only seven
years of age.</p>
<p>1714.&nbsp; Dr. Thurlin&rsquo;s library deposited in St.
Margaret&rsquo;s church, in a commodious place fitted up for its
reception, to which the old church library was at the same time
removed: a faculty being obtained from the bishop.&mdash;The same
year the first commemoration sermon for <i>Framingham</i> was
preached at St. Nicholas&rsquo;s, by Mr. <i>Pyle</i>, for which
he had 20<i>s.</i> and 10<i>s.</i> more <i>for reading the
Will</i>&mdash;which, are still continued.</p>
<p>1715.&nbsp; The first rebellion in behalf of the Pretender
broke out.&nbsp; See p. <span class="indexpageno"><a

<p>1719.&nbsp; January 26. Ordered that none be admitted into
Gaywood Hospital under 60 years old.</p>
<p>1720.&nbsp; John Cary junior (father of our late alderman of
that name) elected master of the Writing-School&mdash;the
aldermen Berney and Scarlet being then Governors and Inspectors
of the same.</p>
<p>1721.&nbsp; Our corporation now, apprehensive of losing the
navigation of the Cambridge river, (from the representation of a
Mr. Stafford of Denver,) which they thought proper to communicate
to the corporation of Adventurers.&nbsp; The result not
stated.</p>
<p>1723.&nbsp; Two new galleries erected in St. Margaret&rsquo;s
church, on the sides of the organ loft; with projections for two
particular families.&mdash;This year (or during the mayoralty of
William Allen, which commenced <a name="page1208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 1208</span>at Michaelmas,) <i>Thomas
German</i> (says one MS.) was hanged here for burglary, on the
gallows out of the South Gates&mdash;Cooper&rsquo;s MS. calls him
<i>Jarmey</i>, in a memorandum which reads
thus&mdash;&ldquo;1723: A night watch set up for all the year,
and the <i>king&rsquo;s watch</i> dropt here, being one Jarmey,
who broke into several houses, and was hanged for the same out of
the South Gates.&rdquo;&mdash;The same MS. referring to the same
year, has this passage&mdash;&ldquo;A great fleet of ships lost
on Christmas day; Mr. Vinkerson&rsquo;s ship right against West
Lynn church, laden with coals.&rdquo;&mdash;Dr. Browne this year
gave great offence to the Hall and especially the mayor&mdash;of
which see p. <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page900">900</a></span>.</p>
<p>1724.&nbsp; The chapel chimes, which formerly played but one
tune, were this year altered, and made to play several tunes.</p>
<p>1725.&nbsp; Ever since 1682 it was customary for each alderman
upon his election to give 10<i>l.</i> and each common-council-man
6<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> towards the Workhouse: but this
year Mr. Thomas Allen, being chosen alderman, refused to comply
with this custom, and thereby occasioned the cessation of those
laudable donations.&nbsp; (Cooper&rsquo;s MS.)&mdash;From the
book of Extracts it seems it was in 1726 Mr. T. A. became an
alderman.&mdash;The harbour now in a most wretched state, see p.
<span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page901">901</a></span>.&mdash;And this year 1725 (if we
are not mistaken, for the last figure is not very plain)
Cooper&rsquo;s MS. mentions a <i>great tide</i>, which happened
on the 8th. of March, and came into a Warehouse in Puddin Lane,
where was a quantity of unslaked lime, which being wetted became
so hot as to set some deals that lay there on fire, so as to
endanger the firing of the town.&nbsp; He seems indeed to say
that it was a piece of <i>iron</i> heated by the quick lime which
set the deals on fire.</p>
<p>1726.&nbsp; <i>Henry Southwell</i>, a freeman, charged by the
corporation (unjustly it seems) with having violated his oath of
freedom, and threatened with disfranchisement.</p>
<p>1727.&nbsp; The mayor, Mr. Thomas Allen issued an order to the
<i>barbers</i>, to <i>prohibit them to shave on
Sundays</i>&mdash;of which see p. <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page910">910</a></span>.&mdash;February 3rd. this year the
above Henry Southwell was disfranchised.</p>
<p>1728.&nbsp; The decree of disfranchisement against Mr.
Southwell was rescinded On the 29th. of April this year; of which
see further at p. <span class="indexpageno"><a

<p>1730.&nbsp; April 6.&nbsp; Our corporation made a remonstrance
to the corporation of the Bedford Level against repairing Denver
Sluice: which was probably very right.</p>
<p>1731.&nbsp; Great complaints of the decrease of trade &amp;c.
here this year.&nbsp; But among the occurrences of this period
the most deplorable and shocking was the <i>murder of Ann
Wright</i>, a publican, by one <i>George Smith</i>, who had been
let into the house in the dead of the night by the servant,
<i>Mary Taylor</i>, for which she was burnt at a stake in the
Tuesday <a name="page1209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1209</span>market-place, and the man was hanged on a gallows, 17
yards distant, on Thursday the 1st. of April, see p. <span

class="indexpageno"><a href="#page914">914</a></span>.</p>
<p>1738.&nbsp; Law-suit between the corporation and alderman
Thomas Allen, who was charged with attempting to evade the
customary payment of 1<i>d.</i> per quarter for corn sold by him
to unfreemen.&nbsp; See p. <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page918">918</a></span>.</p>
<p>1741.&nbsp; On the 9th of September a violent hurricane which
blew down the spires of St. Margaret&rsquo;s and St.
Nicholas&rsquo;s and did immense damage all about the
country.&mdash;St. Margaret&rsquo;s spire falling on the body of
the church demolished a great part of it&mdash;the rebuilding
began in 1742, and was completed in 1747.&mdash;see pp. <span

which were wrecked on the coast: cattle and sheep also in vast
numbers were drowned in Marshland, and about Snettisham,

<p>1764.&nbsp; The town served a vile trick by the mayor, which
they seem to have submitted to very tamely, see <span

very extraordinary tide, the highest known here in the memory of
man; which overflowed and demolished the sea banks in many
places, and did vast damage in and about this town.&mdash;The
Lynn armed association was also formed in the course of this
year, under the command of Captain <i>Thames Day</i>&mdash;and
continued embodied till 1785.&nbsp; See <span

<p>1785.&nbsp; November 5. the Recorder being ill, the mayor,
William Bagge, sat as sole judge at our sessions, and upon the
conviction of John Bradley and another person, his said worship
passed on them the sentence of transportation:&mdash;but with
what solemnity, if any, we have not <a name="page1211"></a><span

of November this year, a Mr. Berry brought to town some young
rooks from Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s Carr at Tilney.</p>
<p>1788.&nbsp; On the 5th of November the centenary of the

if not excel the Holkham Fete.&mdash;A strange report of an
extraordinary adventure of one of our Greenland captains this
year&mdash;see p. <span class="indexpageno"><a

this year were distinguished by the <i>king&rsquo;s memorable
illness</i>, which almost broke the hearts of half his subjects,
and overwhelmed the whole nation with grief and dismay.&nbsp; In
this affliction Lynn, without doubt, shared largely:&mdash;but it
happily proved not of long duration.</p>
<p>1789.&nbsp; On the 12th of February his majesty was pronounced
to be in a state of progressive amendment; and by the 18th of
March he was deemed fit to resume the royal functions.&nbsp; The
joy and exultation of the public now equalled their former grief
and dismay, and they might be said to have gone from one extreme
to the other.&nbsp; On the evening of the day last mentioned this
town was most splendidly illuminated, and exhibited the most
unequivocal tokens of its joy, and demonstrations of its
loyalty.&mdash;See p. <span class="indexpageno"><a

<p>1794.&nbsp; In consequence of great complaints of the
defective and decayed state of the Fen Drainage, the Eau-brink
Cut was proposed and approved of as a remedy.&nbsp; Our trained
bands or armed association again revived&mdash;and the <i>Lynn
Volunteers</i>, infantry and cavalry, landsmen and marines,
blunt-shooters and sharp-shooters, made their appearance among
us.&nbsp; They consisted of different corps, but the most
numerous was commanded by Colonel Everard, which was about three
years after disbanded:&mdash;most of the others still remain, see

vicinity sprung up about the same time&mdash;the martial ardour
of the time extended even to the priesthood.&mdash;On 29 Dec.
this year the Thermometer said to be at 3 below 0: see p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page981">981</a></span>.</p>
<p>1799.&nbsp; The <i>Lynn and Wisbeach Packet</i>, and also the
inglorious <i>Income Tax</i> commenced their progress and
operations: the former with far less success than the
latter.&mdash;A great controversy soon after arose here about the
termination of the century; one party placing it at the close of
this, and the other at the close of the following year: so that
the controversy rested on this curious ground, whether or not 99
was equal to 100.</p>
<p>1800.&nbsp; <i>St. Catherine&rsquo;s Gates</i>, commonly
called East Gates, taken down after having stood above 700
years.&mdash;Sept. 3. The dearness of provisions caused here a
considerable commotion among the common people; and <i>Mr.
Forster</i>, a flour merchant, was very roughly treated by some
of them.&mdash;The attempt of Hadfield upon the king&rsquo;s
life, at the theatre, this summer, caused no small agitation here
and throughout the nation: two very loyal addresses were now
presented to his majesty, by our <i>corporation</i> and the
<i>inhabitants</i>.</p>
<p>1801.&nbsp; The old building or tower, called the Black Mount,
on the town walls, fell this year without doing much damage, as
the ropers had just left it, being their dinner
time.&mdash;816<i>l.</i> 9<i>s.</i> subscribed here this year, to
furnish the poor with <i>pease-soup</i>, which was served out to
them from the Town Hall thrice a week, by reason of the extreme
dearness of provisions.&mdash;Also one <i>Peter Donahue</i>
executed here for forgery.&mdash;The <i>Peace of Amiens</i>
excited no small joy here, and the town was illuminated on the
occasion.</p>
<p>1802.&nbsp; A grand Fete given at Refley Spring, when a whole
sheep, roasted (says one account,) was served up at dinner, as a
<i>peace-offering</i> to the friends of Refley [which <i>friends
of Refley</i>, we may suppose, were the gods worshipped there
that day.]</p>
<p>1803.&nbsp; The first act for <i>paving</i> and improving the
town was now obtained.&mdash;The <i>new-road</i>, from the South
gate to St. James&rsquo;s End, was also made this
year.&mdash;Also the new Burying ground and Chapel consecrated,
by the then bishop of Norwich, Dec. 14.</p>
<p><a name="page1213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1213</span>1806.&nbsp; In the course of this year there was a
very high tide which demolished the remaining ruins of our
Lady&rsquo;s Chapel on the Bridge.&mdash;St. Nicholas&rsquo;s
Chapel this same year thoroughly repaired and greatly improved at
a considerable expense.</p>
<p>1807.&nbsp; His royal highness the <i>duke of Clarence</i>,
attended by <i>Earl Cholmondeley</i> visited Lynn, (13. October,)
and they were both presented with the freedom of this
borough.</p>
<p>1808.&nbsp; The names of many of the Streets of the town were
this year most capriciously, childishly, and confoundingly
changed; and the rage for changing names appeared now so
predominant, that some began to expect no less than that the town
itself was to receive a new name.</p>
<p>In the summer of this year the <i>Lancasterian School</i> was
established here, of which see page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page1145">1145</a></span>.</p>
<p>1809.&nbsp; In the month of October this year, the memorable
<i>Jubilee</i> took place, which was kept and solemnized here
with the greatest hilarity and exultation, as if the commencement
of the present reign had been the introduction of the very
millennium itself.&nbsp; It was a political man&oelig;uvre; and
not the first to which the British public have been the
dupes.</p>
<p>1810.&nbsp; This year a negotiation took place, and was
carried on for some months, between <i>Mr. William Corston</i> of
Ludgate Hill, London, and the Lynn <i>Court of Guardians</i>, in
consequence of a proposal from the former, to furnish employment
for the <i>female</i> children of the Lynn poor, in plaiting of
straw and knitting of hats, on certain terms and conditions:
<i>viz.</i> To be provided with a proper house for the
manufactory, and a dwelling for the superintendents, together
with the loan of a large sum of money, on proper security, for
seven years, without interest.&mdash;This notable treaty was
opened in March, and after a number of Letters had passed between
the parties, it was closed by a Letter from the <i>Registrar</i>
to Mr. Corston, dated Sept. 15. of which the following is a
copy&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sir, I was duly favoured with your Letter
of the 20th. of August, inclosing answers to my questions
respecting your plan for employing the female poor of this
borough, which, with the sketch of the proposed building, &amp;c.
transmitted to Mr. Dixon, I laid before the Court of Guardians at
their meeting, holden on Thursday last; who after having given
the matter their most mature consideration, instruct me to inform
you, that they entirely decline acceding to your
propositions.&nbsp; I therefore return you the several papers,
requesting you will be pleased to accept the thanks of the Court
for the trouble you have had in the business.&nbsp; I am, &amp;c.
J. <i>Smeatham</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the affair ended; happily or otherwise, we take not upon us
to say.</p>
<p>1811.&nbsp; St. Margaret&rsquo;s church thoroughly cleaned,
white washed, and beautified, at considerable expense.&mdash;A
new place of worship, called <i>Salem Chapel</i>
erected&mdash;and premises Purchased, in Tower Street, for the <a
name="page1214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1214</span>erection
of the splendid Methodist minster.&mdash;Those premises cost
between 8 and 900<i>l.</i> and the subsequent erection will cost
between 4 and 5000<i>l.</i> more.&mdash;In the early part of this
year, if we are not mistaken, Mr. Allen, one of our
common&mdash;brewers, relinquished his memorable attempt to dig a
well, after having sunk to the vast depth of 560 feet and spent a
large sum of money without success; so that it seems now that
though Lynn is situated in a bog, the ground below is as
destitute of water as any spot in the kingdom can well be.&nbsp;
Some praise however seems to be due to Mr. A. for having so long
persevered in this arduous undertaking, attended as it was with
so much expense and discouragement.&nbsp; Some curious fossils,
and even bones; were said to be discovered there at a great
depth.</p>
<p>On Saturday evening, Oct. 5, one of the ferry-men in a small
boat, which they use only occasionally, attempting to bring over
from West-Lynn too many passengers, the boat suddenly went down
and every soul perished: They were 9 if not more beside the
ferry-man; and the boat was capable of carrying safely not above
half that number.&nbsp; This fatal disaster was imputed to the
perverse temerity of the boatman.</p>
<p>The last month of this year was rendered memorable by the
death of the most singular and excentric character in the whole
town, and probably in the whole county.&nbsp; His name was
<i>Robert Pursglove</i>: he was descended from very worthy and
reputable parents, who belonged to the respectable society of
Friends or Quakers.&nbsp; With that society he himself was also
generally classed, although for many years past almost every
shade of resemblance between his character and theirs had
disappeared.&nbsp; His parents left him in possession of good
property, which he managed most strangely and in a manner
peculiar to himself.&nbsp; He had a <i>Ship</i>, which he might
have sold for a good sum of money; but he had it laid up, till it
rotted all to pieces&mdash;a number of <i>hay-stacks</i> he also
had, which he might have sold and turned to good account, but he
would hear nothing of that, and they were left, year after year,
till they were quite spoilt and good for nothing.&mdash;He had
<i>kine</i> and other cattle, which were of course neglected and
mismanaged&mdash;he lived in a large house, which he had
purchased, where formerly had resided one of our first families;
but he suffered every thing there to go to decay and utter ruin,
till doors, windows, floors, stair-cases, roofs, and every thing
became perfect pictures of desolation&mdash;his dogs, and even
his swine and kine occupied some of its best apartments, all
ill-fed and half starved.&mdash;In this dreary mansion of
desolation he was himself at last found, in the agonies of death,
resulting from an apoplectic attack, and beyond the possibility
of deriving any relief from medical skill.&nbsp; He is said to
have often wanted food, though he left behind him property to the
amount, as it is reported, of near if not quite
10,000<i>l.</i>&mdash;This sketch might be greatly enlarged, but
this will serve to give the reader some idea of the
eccentricities and peculiarities of this extraordinary
person.</p>
<p><a name="page1215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1215</span>1812.&nbsp; This year has been yet distinguished by
nothing more than a miserable stagnation of trade, and a
probability of the bread and beer and other necessaries of life
being dearer than ever.&nbsp; Nothing, in short, appears to be
going on here now with vigour or spirit, but the methodist
erection above mentioned and taxgathering; so that were we
required to name whatever is here at present in a very thriving
state, or rapidly on the increase, we should be able to mention
scarce any thing besides these two articles, <i>taxation</i> and
<i>methodism</i>.&mdash;As to the much talked of <i>Evening
Lecture</i> at the Church, it will seemingly be given up at last;
our churchmen not having zeal enough to effect its
accomplishment.&mdash;As to the <i>Dispensary</i>, its prospect
of success is far more flattering, and there can be little doubt
now of its speedy establishment: large sums have been already
subscribed, a house has been purchased, or is about to be
purchased, and every thing fairly promises the sure completion of
the undertaking, and the full application of its benefits to
those classes of the inhabitants for whose behoof or relief the
institution is intended.&nbsp; That it has succeeded better than
the proposed <i>Lecture</i>, will perhaps be considered by some
people as an indication, that our wealthy churchmen are more
ready to provide for the <i>corporeal</i> than for the
<i>spiritual</i> accommodation of their neighbours.&mdash;Of the
notable plan of <i>economy</i>, so laudably adopted, and so
steadily pursued during the present mayoralty, to save certain
expenses usually attached to that important office, some account
has been given at pages <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page1087">1087</a></span>, and <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page1154">1154</a></span>.&mdash;Of
the present state of the <i>Workhouse</i>, and the prospect in
regard to the future management of it, and of the
<i>poor-rates</i>, some further observations, in this latter part
of the work, were intended; but our information is too imperfect
to admit of our resuming these subjects at present: we can
therefore only say, that it is to be feared our sanguine hopes of
being greatly benefited by the new plan, or lately adopted
system, will, after all, terminate in useless regret and
vexatious disappointment.&nbsp; Whatever they may do on the other
side, it seems now pretty clear that our managers are not likely
very soon to fall into the sin of being too frugal or economical
in the application of the public money. <a
name="citation1215"></a><a href="#footnote1215"
class="citation">[1215]</a>&mdash;Among the extraordinary and
memorable events of this year, the tragical exit or assassination
of our late premier will be expected, perhaps, to be here
noticed: and much as we do deplore that shocking catastrophe, we
would fain hope it will operate as a warning to all future
ministers, not to trifle with the serious complaints and
sufferings of their fellow subjects.&nbsp; What may be the
results of that fatal and melancholy occurrence, and the
subsequent changes, it is impossible yet to say.&nbsp; They seem
to have already produced the <i>rescinding</i> of the vile and
pernicious <i>orders of council</i>, which had reduced almost
half the nation to distress and beggary, and proved how easily
the Americans can cramp our manufactories.&nbsp; Should they also
produce a <a name="page1216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1216</span>redress of the grievances complained of by the
Catholics and other Dissenters, together with a thorough
parliamentary reform, and a general peace, we may still escape
national perdition, and even hope yet to see brighter and happier
days.&mdash;The convulsion and expulsion lately experienced at
the <i>Independent</i>, or rather <i>Presbyterian</i> chapel, may
be also placed among the remarkable occurrences of this
year.&nbsp; That congregation, it is hoped, (and all our other
congregations) will no longer tolerate <i>priestcraft</i>, or
submit to be <i>priest-ridden</i>.&nbsp; Whatever may be said of
their successors who denominate themselves <i>Independents</i>,
our <i>Presbyterian ministers</i>, we believe, were never
chargeable with priestly domination.</p>

182.&mdash;<i>Carlostadius</i> was Luther&rsquo;s first disciple
of any considerable note: and he co-operated with, and supported
him with great firmness and ability.&nbsp; But having ventured to
alter the mass, during Luther&rsquo;s absence in the year 1521,
and to deny the real presence, the latter commenced a furious war
against him and his followers, and condemned them in terms of the
utmost rancor and bitterness.&nbsp; <i>Melancthon</i> too
(misnamed the <i>mild</i>) now calls him &ldquo;a brutal ignorant
man, void of piety and humanity, one more a Jew than a
christian.&rdquo;&mdash;a rare specimen of mildness and
meekness!</p>
<p><a name="footnote636a"></a><a href="#citation636a"
class="footnote">[636a]</a>&nbsp; See Milner as before,
188.&mdash;It is not said how Henry brooked all this; but it was
well for Luther that he was not within his reach.&nbsp; The most
curious circumstance is that &ldquo;Luther, in giving an account
of his book, reproaches himself with having been <i>too mild</i>
in it towards the king, saying that he did so at the request of
his friends, in hopes that his <i>sweetness</i> would gain
Henry.&rdquo;&mdash;If such was Luther&rsquo;s <i>sweetness</i>,
what could his <i>sourness</i>, or his <i>bitterness</i> be?</p>

should behave as he did to Cariostadius, whose chief crime seems
to be his having acted <i>without his authority</i>, though in
conjunction with Bugenhagius, Melanancthon, Jonas, &amp;c.&nbsp;
He continued afterwards to persecute him with unrelenting
virulence, and nothing would satisfy him short of absolute
submission to his sovereign will and pontifical mandates.&nbsp;
His banishment ensued.&nbsp; He appears to have been one of the
best men among the reformers.&nbsp; It seems, however, that
Luther was at last convinced of his misconduct in this affair,
and obtained permission for his return from exile.&nbsp; See

class="footnote">[642]</a>&nbsp; Their blindness generally
proceeded from a fallacious kind of reasoning, which is still
very common among their orthodox descendants or successors, but
which, like a two-edged sword, cuts both ways.&nbsp; They plead
that they are the people of God, and are in the right way, so
that their cause is the cause of God and truth, and therefore the
papists are cruel persecutors when they deprive them of their
lives or liberties.&nbsp; When they are reminded of having
themselves before now deprived the papists and other christian
sects of their liberties and lives, they answer, that that was
done very justly, as those sufferers were either seditious
persons or heretics, and what they did to them was in the way of
suppressing <i>sedition</i> or restraining <i>heresy</i>.&nbsp;
When they are told that the papists excuse and justify their own
violent proceedings against the protestants much in the same way
and with equal plausibility, they will answer, that what the
papists assert is not true.&nbsp; When they are further told that
the papists insist upon the truth of their allegations and the
falshood of those of the protestants, they will reply that the
papists belonging to a false church and influenced by a lying
spirit, are not to be credited, but as for them, being the people
of God and followers of the truth, their testimony ought to be
received without hesitation.&mdash;Thus their reasoning ends just
where it began&mdash;We are God&rsquo;s people, and therefore our
proceedings are not to be impeached!&nbsp; No better reasoning
can be expected in defence of injustice and persecution.</p>

Gallic Calvinists were no less bigoted and intolerant than their
brethren elsewhere.&nbsp; Their ministers, in 1563, requested
that in order to prevent the propagation of heresy and monstrous
opinions, the king would be pleased to receive into his royal
protection their confession of faith tendered to him in 1561, and
the profession of it; and to provide that atheists, libertines,
anabaptists, and Servetists should be severely punished.&nbsp;

and graunte unto such articles as they propounded unto
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fox A. and M. p. 1736.&nbsp; This happened in
1529.&nbsp; In 1531 he was cited before the archbishop of
Canterbury, Wareham, on fresh charges of heresy, and forced to
sign an abjuration of them&mdash;see Fox, p. 4738.&nbsp; The
third time he was called upon, with certain others, to give an
account of his opinions, by Henry himself, on which occasion he
escaped by an absolute submission of himself to his supreme head
in spiritual matters.&nbsp; His fourth and last recantation was
when he was deprived of his bishopric, and committed prisoner to
the Tower, where he lay till the end of Henry&rsquo;s reign, on
suspicion of heresy, and for violating the fast and abstinence of
Good Friday.&mdash;It has been suggested that imprisonment did
not constitute the whole of his correction or chastisement on
this occasion, as Shaxton bishop of Salisbury was forced to
recant his Lutheran opinions, and carry a faggot at the burning
of four other protestants, in 1546; and it is not likely that
Henry would have been content with less from Shaxton&rsquo;s
fellow prisoner, Latimer, than a solemn abjuration of his
doctrine.&mdash;See Milner, as before, page, 196.</p>

be, that Henry&rsquo;s wish for a divorce arose from his
attachment to Ann Boleyn; but from a paper in the 3rd. volume of
the Harieian Miscellany it appears to be unfounded.&nbsp; We
learn from that paper that archbishop Warham was from the first
averse to Henry&rsquo;s marriage with his brother&rsquo;s widow,
but that Fox bishop of Winchester inclined Henry VII. to be for
it, as a dispensation from the pope would remove all
difficulties.&nbsp; It appears further that the king (Henry VII.)
afterwards thought with Warham: and the day the prince came of
age he by his father&rsquo;s order protested against it as null
and void.&nbsp; His father also with his dying breath persisted
in charging him to break it off.&nbsp; The king continued to have
scruples, and at last sent Cardinal Wolsey to France to negotiate
a match between him and the duchess of Alencon about August
1527.&nbsp; After that Lord Rochford came over from France with
the picture of the duchess.&nbsp; His daughter Ann Boleyn, who
was in the duchess&rsquo; service, came over probably at the same
time; and then it was that Henry set his affection upon
her.&mdash;There can be no truth therefore in the report that she
was the cause of alienating the king&rsquo;s affections from
Catherine, and his scrupling the marriage.&nbsp; The Cardinal
returned from France September 30, 1527; and it was not till
afterwards that the king expressed to him his attachment to Ann
Boleyn.&nbsp; Harl. Misc. vol. 3. p. 43.</p>

him that he had condemned the said Ann Askew not long before for
a piece of bread, and was then ready to condemn her for a piece
of flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; Heylin, Edw. vi, p. 89.&mdash;As three

was granted to Cranmer, with two other bishops and six other
persons, to try <i>summaris el de plano</i>, even though they had
not been denounced or detected, all Anabaptists, &amp;c. and to
deliver them over to the secular arm.&nbsp; Collier vol. 2. sec.

a special commission, Cranmer with certain other bishops tried
Alexander Seaton for protestant opinions, and condemned him to
bear a faggot and recant at St. Paul&rsquo;s Cross, which he did
accordingly.&nbsp; Collier, vol. 2 p. 184.&nbsp; The same year
three other Anabaptists were burnt by virtue of the former
commission.&nbsp; Stow&mdash;In Edward&rsquo;s reign certain
chiefs (of the Gospellers and Anabaptists) were condemned April

class="footnote">[664]</a>&nbsp; The unfavourable and ill effects
of the reformation on the manners, and morals of the people, both
at home and abroad, must be chiefly ascribed to some of the great
defects of the system&mdash;some of its most prominent features
or distinguishing doctrines, as was before suggested&mdash;such
as justification by faith without works, predestination to
perdition as well as to salvation, or election and reprobation
representing all human characters and actions (even the most
horrid crimes), as emanating or resulting from the decrees of
Heaven, or will of God&mdash;doctrines which certainly cannot be
said to be favourable to practical holiness or virtuous
living.&nbsp; Yet they form a main part of what has been called
<i>evangelical</i> religion ever since.&nbsp; As to their
licentious tendency, Luther is known to have gone very far, and
expressed himself very strongly on the above doctrine of
<i>justification</i>; even so as to speak very slightly of the
<i>Epistle of James</i>, calling it &ldquo;dry, chaffy, and
unworthy the apostolic spirit,&rdquo; for no other reason than
its manifest opposition to his views of this doctrine.&nbsp; He
probably deemed that Epistle far inferior to his own writings
when he called himself the <i>second Elias</i> and the <i>Chariot
of Israel</i>, and said in his book against the king of England,
&ldquo;My ministry and calling are of that excellency that it is
in vain for princes or any persons on earth to expect submission
or forbearance from me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Be this as it may, it is
evident, from <i>Bucer&rsquo;s</i> testimony, (see p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page628">628</a></span>) that the
reformed converts made a great handle of that doctrine, and
considered it as excusing and encouraging their licentiousness:
and Bucer was a witness of the effects of the reformation in
England as well as on the continent.&mdash;As to those reformed
doctrines relating to the <i>Divine Decrees</i>, or
predestination to perdition as well as to salvation, and which
are commonly comprehended under the terms Election and
Reprobation, their loose and licentious tendency, must be obvious
to every unbiassed mind, seeing they place good and evil, virtue
and vice, truth and error, right and wrong, as it were upon a
level, and in effect annihilate all the distinctions between
them, making the worst as well as the best of human actions to be
agreeable to the will of God and the offspring of his eternal
counsel or purpose.&nbsp; Where such doctrines prevail it may be
expected that moral restraints will be soon overpowered.</p>
<p><a name="footnote668"></a><a href="#citation668"

use, and their suppression was a real and public loss, in that
view and as things then stood.</p>
<p><a name="footnote672"></a><a href="#citation672"
class="footnote">[672]</a>&nbsp; In the days of Wickliff, and for
a good while after, there was among the common people a spirit of
revolt against papal tyranny and corruption; but that spirit had
been suppressed and extinguished before Henry had begun his work
of reformation.&nbsp; Between his work and that of Wickliff there
was a wide and striking difference&mdash;the former originated
with the court, the latter with some thinking men at Oxford; the
former was carried on by royal caprice, orders of council, and
acts of parliament, the latter by the diligent and persevering
exertions and eloquence of private individuals of integrity and
learning, who were convinced of its importance, and who travelled
on foot about the country to instruct and enlighten the people,
in order to improve their manners, their morals and their
religious principles.</p>
<p><a name="footnote673"></a><a href="#citation673"
class="footnote">[673]</a>&nbsp; This might be the reason why so
many places of worship besides the convents, and which had no
connection with them, were here laid by and demolished at that
time&mdash;such as the church or chapel of St. James, those of
St. John, and of St. Catherine, &amp;c. the demolition of which,
except for the reason now suggested, must appear exceedingly
unaccountable.&mdash;As to the church or chapel of <i>St.
Catherine</i>, of whose site the author expressed much
uncertainty at p. 559, he now begs leave to inform the reader
that he has been since led to conclude, from some old MSS. that
it stood in that small field without the East gate, on the left
hand as we go out of the town, and which is now enclosed from the
road by a brick wall.&nbsp; It appears that it retained the name
of <i>St. Catherine&rsquo;s ground</i> long after the church had
disappeared.</p>
<p><a name="footnote674"></a><a href="#citation674"
class="footnote">[674]</a>&nbsp; Many of them could hardly read;
and as to preaching, it was what few of them were capable
of.&nbsp; To supply that deficiency the <i>Book of Homilies</i>
was provided, and the reading of those homilies, for a while,
appears to have supplied the place of preaching.&nbsp; But the
plan was ill calculated to instruct and enlighten the common
people, though it might be of use to their superiors.</p>

pretty correct statement of the numbers of worshipers that might
be accommodated in each and all our present places of
worship&mdash;In <i>St. Margaret&rsquo;s</i> church; 1322; in
<i>St. Nicholas&rsquo;</i> chapel 1066; in <i>All Saints</i>, or
South Lynn church, 388: in the <i>Methodist chapel</i>, 500; in
the <i>Independent chapel</i> 450; in the <i>Baptist chapel</i>
500; and in that of the Friends or Quakers 100.&mdash;Thus all
the churches might admit 2776; and all the Dissenting chapels
about 1500, or 1550&mdash;in all 4326.&nbsp; But it is well known
that the number of those that do actually attend falls greatly
short of 4326, and we may very safely venture to affirm that they
do not exceed 3000: so that there must be here between 7 and 8000
people whose minds are strangers to religious impressions, and
whose conduct is very little regulated or affected by any sound
moral principles.&nbsp; Would it not therefore be very desirable
to increase among us the means of religious and moral
instruction?&nbsp; Some more new chapels, under proper direction,
might prove of no small benefit to the town, and help to bring
from darkness to light another third part of its
population.&nbsp; This hint deserves consideration.</p>

<i>poor-rates</i> and <i>paving-tax</i>, which are certainly most
severely felt, and likely to be still more so.&nbsp; The former
by frugal and wise management might, doubtless, be greatly
reduced, without any material detriment to the poor: and the
latter ought never to have existed till the times proved more
favourable.&nbsp; When the project was brought forward it was
firmly opposed by a large body of the householders: but it was
carried against them, very wrongfully.&nbsp; They were told that
the work would be completed at the expence of about
13,000<i>l.</i> and it has already far exceeded, if not doubled,
that sum: yet the work is not finished.&nbsp; Thousands have been
lavished, merely to suit the convenience, or gratify the caprice
of a few opulent families, without being of the least use or
benefit to the town at large; which must have been exceedingly
disingenuous and dishonourable.&nbsp; So great was the liberality
which the paviers experienced at Lynn, that they are reported to
be satisfied to do their work at Norwich and Yarmouth, 25 per
cent. under what they had here.&mdash;In short, the managers, or
rather the mis-managers of this concern, went on lavishly and
blunderingly, till they could go no further.&nbsp; They were
aground for sometime this last autumn, and had probably remained
so over the winter, and the summer too, and thrown the whole town
into the utmost confusion, but for the timely assistance of a
certain individual, who on this critical occasion stood in the

all much of the same cast and tenor, and so were probably the

is given by Burnet, and is as follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Forasmuch as we <i>Richard Green</i>, abbot
of our monastery of our blessed lady St. Mary of Betlesden, and
the convent of the said monastery, do profoundly consider, that
the whole manner and trade of living, which we and our pretensed
religion have practised and used many days, does most principally
consist in certain dumb ceremonies, and other certain
constitutions of the bishops of Rome, and other forinsecal
potentates, as the abbot of <i>Cistins</i>, and therein only
noseled and not taught in the true knowledge of God&rsquo;s laws,
procuring always exemptions of the bishops of Rome from our
ordinaries and diocesans: submitting ourselves principally to
forinsecal potentates and powers, which never came here to reform
such disorders of living and abases as now have been found to
have reigned amongst us.&nbsp; And therefore now assuredly
knowing, that the most perfect way of living is most principally
and sufficiently declared unto us by our Master Christ, his
Evangelists and Apostles, and that it is most expedient for us to
be governed and ordered by our supreme Head, under God, the
king&rsquo;s most noble Grace, with our mutual assent and
consent, submit ourselves and every one of us, to the most benign
mercy of the king&rsquo;s majesty; and by these presents do
surrender &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Surrender follows in common form, Signed by the abbot,
subprior, and nine monks, 15th Sept. 30th year of that

the books, some to serve their jakes, some to scour their
candlesticks, and some to rub their boots with: some they sold to
the grocers and soap boilers, and some they sent over sea to the
bookbinders, not in small quantities, but at times whole
shipfulls, to the great wondering of foreign
nations.&mdash;&ldquo;A merchant (he says) bought the contents of
two noble libraries for 40<i>s.</i> a-piece.&nbsp; This stuff he
used for more than ten years instead of grey paper to wrap up his
goods with, and yet he hath enough remaining for many years to
come.&rdquo;&nbsp; (See Seward&rsquo;s An. vol. 1. 49.)&nbsp; All
this discovers some strange mismanagement on the part of the
government.</p>

class="footnote">[720]</a>&nbsp; We are told that there is a copy
of Paramo&rsquo;s book now in Dr. Williams&rsquo;s library in
Red-Cross Street, London, and a most extraordinary production it
appears to be.&nbsp; It was undertaken under the patronage of
<i>Don Gaspar de Quiroga</i>, then abp. of Toledo, and Inquitor
general, and first printed at Madrid in 1614.&mdash;It begins by
proving <i>God</i> himself to have been the <i>first</i>
inquisitor&mdash;He convicts Adam and Eve of pertinacious heresy,
infidelity, apostacy, and blasphemy.&nbsp; God cited Adam,
otherwise the process would have been null.&nbsp; On Adam&rsquo;s
appearance, He enquired, that is, made <i>inquisition</i> into
the crime.&nbsp; The man accused his <i>wife</i>, then the judge
questioned her: He did not examine the <i>Serpent</i>, because of
his obstinacy.&mdash;The examinations were secret and separate,
that there might be no collusive lying.&nbsp; He calls no
witness; the inquisitor overlooks the reason, that there were
none to call, and affirms that conscience and confession are a
thousand witnesses, and save the judge all the trouble, except
that of condemning.&nbsp; The whole was done secretly, that it
might be a precedent for the holy office; and so closely does
this holy office observe the precedent, that they make the dress
of penitent offenders after the very pattern of the clothes which
God made for Adam and Eve, and confiscate all the property of a
heretic, because Adam and Eve were turned out of
paradise.&mdash;The author further maintains, that <i>Abraham</i>
was an inquisitor, and <i>Sarah</i> likewise; for she turned
<i>Ishmael</i> out of doors for <i>idolatry</i>.&nbsp; In this
manner he goes on through the Pentateuch, and the books of Joshua
and Judges, finding inquisitors all the way
through.&mdash;<i>David</i> was a staunch inquisitor.&nbsp;
<i>Zimri</i>, who slew his master, was of the holy office: so was
<i>Elijah</i>.&nbsp; <i>Elisha</i> and <i>Jehu</i> also are among
the heroes of persecution; and <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> most
unexpectedly proves to be an inquisitor also.&mdash;Under the
Gospel, <i>Christ</i> was the first inquisitor: the lice, which
devoured Herod, and the rulers who spoiled the Jews, only
executed the sentences of death and confiscation which he had
pronounced.&nbsp; <i>James</i> and <i>John</i>, who proposed to
have the Samaritan heretics destroyed by fire, were inquisitors,
of course.&nbsp; Then follow the <i>apostles</i>, and after them
the <i>popes</i>. &amp;c.&nbsp; Thus the divine origin and
authority of the horrid inquisition is proved from
scripture&mdash;and proved as plainly and conclusively too, as
many venerated religious tenets and usages are now every day
proved by some of our most renowned protestant writers:&mdash;for
instance the precious contents of the athanasian creed, the
popular rite of infant sprinkling, and the whole ceremony of what
is called christening.&nbsp; The scriptures seem no less violated
or abused, in being brought to support these, than they are in
being brought to support the inquisition.&nbsp; Let us therefore
not be too severe on Luiz de Paramo for writing such book as that
here noticed.</p>

those, as pointed out sometimes by our law writers and others, is
not a little curious: <i>conjurers</i> are said to differ from
<i>witches</i> and <i>wizards</i>, in that the former endeavour
by prayers and invocations to compel the devil to say or do what
they command him; whereas the latter deal rather by friendly and
voluntary conference with the devil, or familiar, to have their
wishes obtained in lieu of <i>blood</i>, or other gift
offered.&nbsp; Both conjuration and witchcraft differ from
enchantment or sorcery.&nbsp; The sorcerer is supposed to have
personal conferences with the devil, and by the use of certain
superstitious words and incantations, or by means of images, is
said to produce strange and preternatural effects.&mdash;All
these false and wild notions must have originated from knavery
and imposture, on the one hand, and credulity and superstition on
the other.&nbsp; <i>Juggling</i>, or notable skill in the arts of

class="footnote">[744]</a>&nbsp; The circumstances which led, as
it is said, to this trial, being not a little remarkable, may be
here related for the reader&rsquo;s edification.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lord chief justice Holt, who had been wild
in his youth, was once out with some of his raking companions on
a journey into the country.&nbsp; Having spent all their money it
was resolved that they should part company and try their fortune
separately.&nbsp; Holt got to an inn at the end of a straggling
village, and putting a good face on the matter, ordered his horse
to be well taken care of, called for a room, bespoke a supper,
and looked after his bed.&nbsp; He then strolled into the
kitchen, where he saw a lass about thirteen years old shivering
with an ague; he inquired of his landlady, a widow, who the girl
was, and how long she had been ill.&nbsp; The good woman told him
that she was her daughter, an only child, and had been ill near a
year, notwithstanding all the assistance she could procure from
physic, at an expence which almost ruined her.&nbsp; He shook his
head at the doctors, and bade the landlady be under no further
concern, for that her daughter should never have another
fit.&nbsp; He then wrote a few unintelligible words in court hand
on a scrap of parchment which had been the directions to a
hamper, and rolling it up, ordered that it should be bound upon
the girl&rsquo;s wrist, and remain there till she was well.&nbsp;
As it happened the ague returned no more; and Holt, having
continued there a week, now called for his bill, with as much
courage as if his pockets had been filled with gold.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Ah! God bless you,&rsquo; said the landlady, &lsquo;you
are nothing in my debt, I&rsquo;m sure; I wish I was able to pay
you for the cure you have performed upon my daughter; and if I
had had the happiness to see you ten months ago, it would have
saved me forty pounds in my pocket.&rsquo;&nbsp; Holt, after some
altercation, accepted of his week&rsquo;s accommodation as a
gratuity, and rode away.&nbsp; It happened that many year&rsquo;s
afterwards, when he was lord chief justice of the king&rsquo;s
bench, he went a circuit into the same county; and among other
criminals whom he had to try, there was an old woman who was
charged with witchcraft: to support this charge several witnesses
swore that she had a spell with which she could either cure such
cattle as were sick, or destroy those that were well: in the use
of this spell they said she had been lately detected, and it
having been seized upon her, was ready to be produced in court:
the judge then desired it might be handed up to him: it appeared
to be a dirty ball, covered with rags and bound many times round
with pack-thread: these coverings he removed with great
deliberation, one after another, and at last found a piece of
parchment, which he knew to be the same that he had used as an
expedient to supply his want of money.&nbsp; At the recollection
of this incident he changed colour, and sat silent: at length,
recollecting himself, he addressed the jury to this effect:
&lsquo;Gentlemen, I must now relate a particular of my life,
which very ill suits my present character, and the station in
which I now sit: but to conceal it would be to aggravate the
folly for which I ought to atone, to endanger innocence, and
countenance superstition: this bauble, which you suppose to have
the power of life and death, is a senseless scrawl which I wrote
with my own hand and gave the woman, whom, for no other cause,
you accuse for a witch.&rsquo;&nbsp; He then related the
particular circumstances of the transaction, and expatiated on
the evil of such prosecutions: and it had such an effect upon the
minds of the people, who now blushed at the folly and the cruelty
of their zeal, that the poor woman was acquitted, and was the
last that ever was tried for witchcraft in that county, and, as
some say, in this kingdom.&rdquo;</p>

class="footnote">[749]</a>&nbsp; The cart was overturned on the
5th of May, 1808.&nbsp; On the following Sunday Evening, the 8th
of the same month, as the minister of the parish informs us,
&ldquo;a considerable number of people assembled together, as it
grew dark, and taking with them the young women ridiculously
supposed to be bewitched, about ten o&rsquo;clock proceeded to
the house of <i>Wright Izzard</i>, which stands alone at some
distance from the body of the village.&nbsp; When they arrived at
this solitary spot, so favourable for the execution of their
villanous designs, they broke into the poor man&rsquo;s house,
dragged his wife out of bed, and threw her naked into the yard;
where her arms were torn with pins, her head was dabbed against
the large stones of the causeway&mdash;and her face, stomach, and
breast were severely bruised with a thick stick that served as a
bar to the door.&nbsp; Having thus satisfied themselves, the mob
dispersed.&nbsp; The woman then crawled into her house, put on
her clothes and went to the constable, who said, he could not
protect her, because he was not sworn.&rdquo;&nbsp; The humanity,
protection, and assistance which she could not find at the
constable&rsquo;s very happily for herself she found under the
roof of a poor widow; who unlocked her door at the first call,
wrapped up her neighbour&rsquo;s bleeding arms with the nicest
linen rags she had, affectionately sympathized with and comforted
her, and gave her a bed.&nbsp; But, horrible to relate! the
compassion and kindness of this poor woman, were the means of
shortening her days.&nbsp; &ldquo;The protectors of a witch are
just as bad as the witch, and deserve the same treatment!&rdquo;
cried the infatuated and savage populace, the next morning.&nbsp;
This so affected and terrified the poor companionate widow that
she actually died soon after.&mdash;The next evening, that of
Monday the 9th of May, Ann Izzard was a second time dragged out
of her house, when her arms were again torn with pins till they
streamed afresh with blood.&nbsp; Alive the next morning, and
apparently likely to survive this attack also, her enemies
resolved to have her <i>ducked</i>, as soon as the labour of the
day was over.&nbsp; On hearing this, she hastily quitted her
home, and took refuge in the house of the minister of the parish;
where the vile wretches durst not follow her.&mdash;The worthy
clergyman, for taking her part, and becoming her protector, lost
the good opinion, and incurred the detestation of a great part of
his parishioners; and if he and his friends had not had recourse
to the strong arm of the law it is impossible to say where the
madness would have ended.&mdash;See Preface to a sermon against
Witchcraft, preached in the parish church of Great Paxton, July
17. 1808.&nbsp; By the rev. J. <i>Nicholson</i>, curate of that
parish.</p>
<p><a name="footnote751"></a><a href="#citation751"
class="footnote">[751]</a>&nbsp; Of these occurrences, one
relates to a certain farmer, not far off, with his neighbours,
and a <i>cunning man</i> whom he went to consult on an
interesting occasion.&mdash;It was intended to relate it somewhat
circumstantially, as it proves the general belief in Witchcraft
which still prevails among our country people: but for certain
reasons, needless here to mention, we refrain for the
present.&mdash;Another of those occurrences appertains to the
<i>town</i>, and to such of its inhabitants who profess to think
most freely for themselves, and to search most diligently after
truth.&mdash;How little these good people have yet got beyond
their blind and boorish country neighbours in some important
points of doctrine, and how unlikely they are at present ever to
make much progress in scriptural or religious knowledge, will
appear from the mighty offence or alarm which many of them are
said to have taken at a late attempt of one of their ministers to
correct some of their absurd and stupid notions relating to the
<i>devil</i>.&nbsp; Among these devout alarmists, or rather at
their head, are said to be the revd. S. N. and the revd. I. A.
two gentlemen of about equal respectability, as well as equal
profoundness of understanding.&nbsp; But why need we to wonder at
any thing of the kind at Lynn?&mdash;it is not very long ago
since some of these very people took upon them to pronounce a
certain case of <i>insanity</i> to be verily a case of
<i>diabolical possession</i>: and as they thought the demon to be
of that kind that would not go out but by <i>prayer</i> and
<i>fasting</i>, they actually kept praying and fasting meetings
for the express purpose of dislodging the foul fiend!&mdash;But
these follies may, perhaps, be more properly castigated when we
come to exhibit the <i>present state</i> of the town.&nbsp; We
will therefore defer, till then, the final execution of the
business.&nbsp; But it is really most disgusting to think, after
the millions this nation pays annually to its moral and religious
instructors, how ignorant the greatest part of the people still
are.&nbsp; Most of these instructors must either be ignorant
themselves, or desirous that the people should continue so.&nbsp;
In either case, it is a shameful consideration.&mdash;With
<i>ten</i> or <i>twelve thousand</i> pastors of our national
church, and two rich and famous universities, nurseries of new
pastors, all maintained at an annual expense, perhaps, of no less
than <i>ten millions sterling</i>: (not to mention the numerous
pastors and teachers belonging to all our other sects, maintained
also at <i>no small</i> expense,)&mdash;with all these, we will
venture to say, our country ought to be much better taught, and
in a far more enlightened state than it now is.&nbsp; But while
our pastors and teachers are either too ignorant to enlighten the
people, or influenced by hypocrisy, fear, or worldly policy, so
as to be loth to disturb the minds or offend their bigoted
hearers, by attacking their favourite errors and endeavouring to
undeceive them, there seems but little chance of our ever getting
much further informed or enlightened.</p>

may prove acceptable and satisfactory to the reader, the author
takes the liberty of introducing them here from a MS. Volume of
extracts from the town-books, in the handwriting of one of the
former aldermen, whence some of the preceding quotations have
also been drawn.&mdash;With regard to the <i>short</i> parliament
of 1640 we meet in this MS. the following Note&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;March 13. (1639, 40.)&nbsp; This day Mr
Mayor, (Thomas Toll Esq) brought in and caused to be openly read
in the House a Warrant or precept directed to him from Thomas
Windham Esq. High Sheriffe of this county of Norfolk, to elect
and choose according to Law two Burgesses for this Burgh to serve
in the parliament summon&rsquo;d to be holden at Westminster on
the 13th April next coming: and Mr. <i>Mayor</i>, the
<i>Aldermen</i> and <i>Common Councell</i> have now accordingly
chosen Mr. Doughty and Mr. Gurlyn, two Aldermen of the said
burgh, to be burgesses to serve in the said parliament for this
borough; and have agreed that Indentures shall be presently made
and sealed according to law between the High Sherife and the said
Electors: and yt is farther ordered and agreed, that the said two
Burgesses, during their service in the said parliament, shall
have payd and allowed them, by the town, for their wages, five
shillings a day apiece.&nbsp; (Wm. Doughty and Th. Gurlyn were
the eldest Aldermen.&rdquo;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the election for the ensuing, or long parliament the
following notice occurs&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;1640, October, 12th.&nbsp; This day two
Letters were by Mr. Mayor (Wm. Doughty Esq.) offered and read in
the House, the one sent to the mayor, Aldermen, and burgesses, by
the Earle of Arundell, Lord Gridall, the other to Mr. Mayor
himselfe, the effect of both Lrs. being to elect a burgess to
serve in the next insuing parliament, Contain[ing] whom his
lordship hath nominated in his said Letter, and that it is
unanimously agreed by this House, that they will choose no other
burgesses to serve in parliament but only such as are resident
and inhabitants within the Corporation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this instance the Corporation discovered what may be called
a dignified and independent spirit; and what was no less to their
credit, they also discovered a regard for rectitude and equity,
in allowing the freemen at large, as was before hinted, to have a
voice now, for the very <i>first time</i>, in the election of
their representatives.&nbsp; Of the parliaments of 1653, 1654,
and 1656 we have spoken already: Of that of 1658, or rather 1659,
we have the following notice in the same book&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;December 31. (1658.)&nbsp; This day Mr.
Mayor (Henry Bell) brought into this house a precept to him
directed, from John Hedley Esq. Sherife of Norfolk for election
of two burgesses to serve in the next parliament, to be holden
upon the 27th. January next, for this burrough of King&rsquo;s
Lynn, which was read in this House, and it is thereupon ordered
that the election of the said burgesses to sitt in parliament be
made <i>in this House by the members of this House according to
the antient custome</i>, on the 3rd January next, and that
publication and warning thereof be made, to the end all persons
concerned in the same election may take notice
thereof.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Four days after, the following note occurs, relating to the
same election&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;January 3rd.&nbsp; Whereas severall
burgesses of this burrough, <i>of the commons at large</i>, have
made their requests to this House, that they might be admitted to
join with this House in the election of burgesses to sitt in the
next parliament, it is ordered that the resolves of the Committee
of Priviledges of the last parliament, and the Parliament&rsquo;s
orders thereon concerning elections be first read to
them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then it is added&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This day upon further debate, it being
adjudged by this House that the right of election of the
burgesses is at present in this House, according to the aforesaid
order, it is therefore ordered that this House doe proceed to an
election accordingly: and that in case the Commons at large shall
after such election persist in their desires to have the Precept
for the elections of burgesses to be read unto them, that the
same be read unto them accordingly, for their
satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then it is added in another paragraph, as before&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This day the Mayor, Aldermen, and common
Councel have elected and chosen Mr. Th. Toll, one of the aldermen
of this burrough and Capt. Griffith Loyd to be burgesses for this
burrough in the next parliament to be holden the 27th
instant.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next after this we read as follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;January 5th.&nbsp; This day by order of
this House the Common Seal is taken out of the Treasury and
affixed unto ane Indenture for the election of Mr. Alderman Toll
and Capt. Griffith Loyd to be burgesses in the next parliament
for this Burrough of King&rsquo;s Lynn.&rdquo;</p>

class="footnote">[783]</a>&nbsp; The number, if we mistake not,
is <i>eight</i>; the <i>recorder</i>, <i>three</i> aldermen, and
<i>four</i> common-council-men.&nbsp; What blame is imputable to
them, may not be easy to say.&nbsp; We are willing to suppose it
may not be very much; at least, not so much as what belongs to
their resident brethren, who have it in their power to strike off
their names from the list of members: and though it may not be of
any material consequence to the community at large if they be
still continued on the list of members, or if <i>eight</i>, or
even <i>eighteen</i> more were to become absentees and retain
their respective memberships; yet in point of good policy it may
not be quite the thing, lest the <i>unprivileged</i> part of the
townsmen should by decrees take it into their heads, that it
would be no very serious cause of alarm if the whole corporation,
except the mayor, recorder, and town clerk, were to set out in a
body to make the <i>tour of Europe</i>, or to perform a <i>voyage
round the world</i>.</p>
<p><a name="footnote787"></a><a href="#citation787"
class="footnote">[787]</a>&nbsp; We also learn that the
<i>expense</i> at this period <i>of taking up one&rsquo;s
freedom</i> in this town (according to ancient custom) amounted
to only 7<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> which was divided as follows,
viz.&nbsp; To the prisoners 4<i>d.</i>&mdash;to the poor
1<i>s.</i>&mdash;to the officers 1<i>s.</i>&mdash;to Mrs.

1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to Mr. Mayor, and 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to
the town-clerk,) total 7<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>&mdash;The expense is
a good deal more now; but to those who obtain their freedom by
inheritance, or servitude, it is far from being exorbitant.</p>

class="footnote">[796b]</a>&nbsp; In 1657 and 1658 our reforming
magistrates carried on their rigorous measures with so high a
hand that not a few of the drawers, or publicans, were heavily
fined, and 30 of them, as was said before, actually
imprisoned.&nbsp; No less than 300 <i>tickets</i> were also, in
the mean time, issued or given out against different defaulters,
as we learn from one of the MS. accounts of that period.</p>
<p><a name="footnote797"></a><a href="#citation797"
class="footnote">[797]</a>&nbsp; They were not all, it seems, the
daughters of respectable or opulent families: 200 of them, if we
rightly understand one of our MSS. were poor girls, clothed at
the expense of Captain Wharton and Mr. Kirby, two newly restored
aldermen, and both flaming royalists.&nbsp; It was very natural
for the young girls to be then brisk and joyful, if it were only
to find themselves unexpectedly, and all of a sudden, so well and
gayly clad.&nbsp; The other hundred lasses may be supposed to
have been clothed at their own expense, or that of their parents
and friends.</p>
<p><a name="footnote800"></a><a href="#citation800"
class="footnote">[800]</a>&nbsp; The following hints from Kimber
may serve to throw some further light on the above Address and
the circumstances that led to it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Such was the animosity between the court
and country parties at this time (1679) that it looked as if the
year <i>Forty-One</i> was going to be acted over again; which
probably had been the case, if the king&rsquo;s necessities had
occasioned him to make the parliament perpetual, as his father
had done&mdash;if Scotland had not been so effectually enslaved,
by a standing army which the court kept there, that they had not
power to stir&mdash;and if the bishops and clergy had been as
disagreeable to most of the people as they were at that
time.&nbsp; Besides, all the staunch episcopalians, fearing the
presbyterians might again subvert the established church,
forgetting the dangers of popery, joined themselves so firmly
with the court, as to make it at last formidable to the other
party.&nbsp; During the repeated prorogations of the present
parliament abundance of addresses were presented from all parts
to petition for its speedy sitting; which being highly
distasteful to the court, means were found to have a number of
<i>counter-addresses</i>, expressing the greatest
<i>abhorrence</i> of such petitions, as an infringement upon the
prerogative, which they took care in their expressions to advance
as high as possible.&nbsp; And so the nation became divided into
two parties, <i>Petitioners</i> and <i>Abhorrers</i>, soon known
by the names of <i>Whigs</i> and <i>Tories</i>, which the
parties, by way of reproach, gave each other: <i>Tory</i> being
the name of an <i>Irish</i> robber, and <i>Whig</i> signifying
sour-milk, an appellation first given to the <i>Scotch</i>
presbyterians.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus it appears that the Lynn corporation were then rank
<i>tories</i>, or <i>Abhorrers</i>&mdash;that is, they abhorred
liberty and loved slavery.&nbsp; How much things have changed
among us for the better since, is a question that we will not now
attempt to resolve.</p>

class="footnote">[805]</a>&nbsp; This prince afterwards, in 1715,
made an unsuccessful effort to recover the throne of his
ancestors, to which he and many others thought he had so
undoubted right.</p>
<p><a name="footnote806"></a><a href="#citation806"
class="footnote">[806]</a>&nbsp; This was perhaps the expulsion
from the Hall of the mayor, town-clerk, five aldermen, and eight
common-councilmen, by order of Council, and appointing others who
were thought better of (and who were among the present
addressers) in their room, by royal mandate.&nbsp; Among the
latter was <i>Henry Framingham</i>.&nbsp; This happened in
June.</p>
<p><a name="footnote812"></a><a href="#citation812"
class="footnote">[812]</a>&nbsp; It is somewhat remarkable that
our present members are descended from those two gentlemen who
represented the town so long ago.&nbsp; One of the Walpoles has
represented it almost ever since, and a moiety of the
representation of Lynn is now considered as almost hereditary in
that family.&nbsp; One of our present members is generally on the
<i>right</i> and the other on the <i>wrong</i> side in the House:
for they are mostly on opposite sides.</p>
<p><a name="footnote820"></a><a href="#citation820"
class="footnote">[820]</a>&nbsp; A late friend of the present
writer assured him that he was once servant to her grandfather,
who, if he rightly recollects, was a <i>baker</i> at
Downham.&nbsp; His enormous vanity, after he grew rich, caused
people often to advert to the meanness of his origin.</p>

class="footnote">[826]</a>&nbsp; The author has a Norwich
farthing of 1667, which it a year earlier than any of those of
Lynn that have fallen in his way.&nbsp; Very few of these tokens
appeared before the restoration.&nbsp; They became then very
common for ten years or more.</p>

abridged occasionally.</p>
<p><a name="footnote834"></a><a href="#citation834"
class="footnote">[834]</a>&nbsp; The above trial cost the people
of South Lynn 42<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>&mdash;The

costs&mdash;&ldquo;For six horses hire to Thetford 1<i>l.</i>

6<i>d.</i>&mdash;Six men&rsquo;s diet and horse meat at Thetford,
1<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>&rdquo;&mdash;A bill of costs or
expences on a similar occasion at present, would make a very
different appearance.&mdash;We cannot dismiss this subject
without suggesting a wish, that this had been the very last
foolish and disgraceful lawsuit that our corporation have been
engaged in.</p>
<p><a name="footnote837"></a><a href="#citation837"
class="footnote">[837]</a>&nbsp; Of this affair <i>Burnet</i>
speaks as follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A bill of indictment was presented to the
Grand Jury against Lord Shaftsbury.&nbsp; The Jury was composed
of many of the chief citizens of London.&nbsp; The Witnesses were
examined in open Court, contrary to the usual custom: they swore
many incredible things against him, mixed with other things that
looked very like his extravagant way of talking.&nbsp; The
draught of the Association was also brought as a proof of his
treason, though it was not laid in the indictment, and was proved
only by one witness.&nbsp; The Jury returned Ignoramus upon the
bill.&nbsp; Upon this the Court did declaim with open mouth
against these juries; in which they said the spirit of the party
did appear, since men even upon oath shewed they were resolved to
find bills true or ignoramus as they pleased, without regarding
the evidence.&nbsp; And upon this a new set of <i>addresses</i>
went round the kingdom, in which they expressed their abhorrence
of that association found in Lord Shaftsbury&rsquo;s cabinet; and
complained that justice was denied the king: which were set off
with all the fulsome rhetoric that the penners could varnish them
with.&rdquo;&nbsp; H. O. T. 2. 153</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="footnote838"></a><a href="#citation838"
class="footnote">[838]</a>&nbsp; See Burnet H. O. T. 2. 535.</p>
<p><a name="footnote840"></a><a href="#citation840"
class="footnote">[840]</a>&nbsp; From the preceding extracts it
appears that the corporation affected or pretended to have
surrendered their old charters <i>voluntarily</i>, or as their
own free and spontaneous act and deed: hence they speak of having
done it <i>with one assent and content</i>&mdash;<i>freely
surrendering</i>&mdash;as the <i>act and deed of the mayor and
burgesses</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>&nbsp; Whereas it was all the effect
of constraint, or imperious and unavoidable necessity.&nbsp; The
same was the case with the monks and friers at the reformation,
previously to the dissolution of the monasteries: they all
solemnly declared, in their instruments of surrender, that they
acted <i>freely</i> and <i>without compulsion</i>, though the
contrary was well known to have been invariably the fact.&nbsp;
Thus it is very clear that the surrendering of the charters as
well as of the convents was a scene of hypocrisy and
falshood.</p>
<p><a name="footnote841"></a><a href="#citation841"
class="footnote">[841]</a>&nbsp; The Charter here alluded to,
(being the 2nd. and last of those obtained from Charles II,)
contains the following clause&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;PROVIDED always, and full power and
authority to Us our Heirs and Successors by these Presents we
resume, and from time to time and at all times hereafter the
Steward, Mayor, Recorder, Town-clerk, and all or any of the
Justices of the Peace, or of the Aldermen, or of the
Common-Councell, or of the Coroners of the Burgh aforesaid, or of
other officers, members, or ministers of the same Burgh for the
time being, at the will and pleasure of Us, or of our Heirs and
Successors, by any of our order or any order of our Heirs and
Successors in Privy Councell made and under the Seal of them
signified respectively to remove, or to declare to be removed,
and as often as We and our Heirs and Successors by any such our
order made in Privy Councell declare the same Steward, Mayor,
Recorder, Town-clerk, and all or any of the Justices of the
Peace, of the Aldermen, and of the Common-Councell, or of the
Coroners of the said Burgh for the time being, or of the other
Officers, members, ministers, to be removed from their respective
offices aforesaid, That then from thenceforth the Steward, Mayor,
&amp;c. &amp;c. of the same Burgh for the time being so removed
or declared to be removed from their several and respective
offices, Ipso Facto and without any further process, really and
to all intents and purposes whatsoever, are and shall be removed,
and this as often as the case shall so happen, any thing to the
contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sufficiently shews how completely in the king&rsquo;s
power this memorable Charter placed our corporation, so as to be
no longer any better than mere and miserable tools and vassals of
the court.</p>
<p><a name="footnote843"></a><a href="#citation843"
class="footnote">[843]</a>&nbsp; The <i>oaths</i> being
<i>dispensed with</i> seems to imply that some of them were
<i>catholics</i>, or that way inclined.&nbsp; Their places and
new honours, however, they did not long retain; for about a
fortnight before the arrival of the prince of Orange they were
all in their turn displaced, and the old ones were restored: only
<i>Mr. Cyprian Anderson</i> was readmitted and chosen
mayor.&nbsp; Of this event one of our old MS. histories gives the
following account&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On the 20th of October John Davy was
displaced and Cyprian Anderson was chosen mayor, by reason of the
king&rsquo;s proclamation for restoring Corporations to their
ancient rights and priviledges; at which time all those members
that came in with the New Charter, or by Mandamus, were
displaced, and the old ones put in again: at which sudden
alterations all expressed great satisfaction, appearing by the
people ringing of bells and firing of guns: and on the 22nd. Mr
mayor bringing home the mayoress out of the country was met with
near a hundred horsemen and received with firing of guns and
ringing of bells, and all sorts of people striving to exceed in
their acclamations of joy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus it appears that even Lynn, at last, came to partake in
some degree of the then prevailing national aversion to the
system or measures of the court.</p>
<p><a name="footnote845a"></a><a href="#citation845a"
class="footnote">[845a]</a>&nbsp; They were again brought back
and restored to their former places at the end of about eleven
months; for it is noted in the Town Books, under the date of
Sept. 27 1689.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Gunns, &amp;c. were returned from
Hull.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote845b"></a><a href="#citation845b"
class="footnote">[845b]</a>&nbsp; That nobleman, if the author is
not mistaken, was the last <i>protestant</i> duke of Norfolk
before the present.&nbsp; He was very active after the arrival of
the prince of Orange in promoting the cause of the revolution in
this county, and nowhere perhaps more so than he was in this
town.&nbsp; For we find that he came here himself on that
occasion, assembled the inhabitants and harangued them, in the
market-place and elsewhere, so successfully, that he seemed to
have brought them over altogether to his own way of thinking
before he left the town.&nbsp; It is therefore probable that the
change which then took place in the politicks of Lynn was in no
small measure owing to his exertions.&nbsp; A remarkable anecdote
concerning him used to be related by some ancient people at
Norwich 30 or 40 years ago, the substance of which was to the
following purport.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The duke, in the summer and autumn of 1688
was suspected by James and his ministers to be inimical to their
proceedings, and was therefore narrowly watched by their
emissaries, of which he himself was not unconscious.&nbsp; He
resided then chiefly at his palace in Norwich, where his evenings
were generally spent with large parties of the principal
inhabitants of the city and its vicinity, which consisted not
merely of protestants, but also of catholics, who would not be
likely to connive at, or conceal any symptoms of dissaffection or
disloyalty which they might discover in his conduct.&nbsp; Some
correspondence was said to have been carried on between him and
the prince of Orange; but on some very particular occasion, not
specified by the narrators of the anecdote, he wished for a
personal interview with the prince.&nbsp; This would be a
hazardous undertaking, as he was then circumstanced; yet he
resolved to make the attempt.&nbsp; It was now about Michaelmas,
or later, when the prince had collected his forces, had arranged
the plan of his expedition to this country, and was preparing to
embark.&nbsp; The Duke procured a small fast sailing vessel with
all possible secrecy, which was to wait for him, at a given time,
somewhere on the Norfolk coast.&nbsp; The very day previous to
his intended embarkation, he invited a large party of his
accustomed guests to spend the evening with him at Norwich, and
they staid there till a late hour.&nbsp; As soon as they were
gone, he and a trusty servant mounted their horses and rode
towards the sea-coast.&nbsp; Not far from the spot where the
vessel lay, there was a farm-house occupied by one of his
tenants.&nbsp; When they came nigh to that house he alighted, bid
his servant take the horses to the farm house and stay there till
he should come to him, as he had some business to transact in the
neighbourhood, and would join him as soon as possible.&nbsp; He
then walked towards the vessel and got aboard.&nbsp; The wind
then proving fair, he was in a few hours conveyed to the Dutch
coast, nigh to the place where the prince lay encamped.&nbsp; He
went ashore without loss of time, walked towards the tent or head
quarters of the prince.&nbsp; But as he was going along he
overheard an English soldier say to his comrade, &lsquo;There
goes the Duke of Norfolk.&rsquo;&nbsp; Alarmed at finding he was
discovered, he walked on, apparently unconcerned; but before he
got to the Head Quarters he turned aside, returned another way to
the vessel, went aboard again, and immediately set sail for
England.&nbsp; The wind now proving fair, as before, he actually
reached the Norfolk coast before night, near the selfsame spot
where he had before embarked.&nbsp; He then walked to the
farm-house, remounted his horse and arrived at Norwich early in
the evening.&nbsp; He then sent for the same party that had been
the preceding evening with him, who spent that evening there as
they had done the former, no one having the least idea of his
extraordinary adventure.&nbsp; This proved a wise precaution; for
the soldier&rsquo;s report having reached the ears of
James&rsquo;s emissaries in Holland, intelligence of it was
immediately conveyed to the English court, when a messenger was
forthwith dispatched to Norwich to arrest the Duke.&nbsp; His
Grace, in order to discredit, or refute the report, appealed to
the parties or guests above mentioned, many of whom were
catholicks, who affirmed that he was at home at his own house in
Norwich the evening immediately preceding and that immediately
succeeding the day in which he was said to have been seen in
Holland.&nbsp; This attestation was deemed a sufficient proof of
an alibi, and it delivered the Duke from the danger which
threatened him.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whereas by the late most terrible and
dreadful storms of wind; with which it has pleased almighty God
to afflict the greatest part of this our kingdom on Friday and
Saturday, the 26th. and 27th. days of November last; some of our

destroyed and lost at sea, and great numbers of our subjects
serving on board the same have perished, and many houses and
other buildings of our good subjects have been either wholly
thrown down and demolished, or very much damnified and defaced,
and thereby several persons have been killed, and many stacks of
corn and hay thrown down and scattered abroad, to the great
damage and impoverishment of many others, especially the poorer
sort; and great number of timber and other trees have by the said
storm been torn up by the roots, in many parts of this our
kingdom.&nbsp; A calamity of this sort so dreadful and
astonishing, that the like hath not been or felt in the memory of
any person living in this, our kingdom, and which loudly calls
for the deepest and most solemn humiliation of us and our
people.&nbsp; Therefore, out of a deep and pious sense of what
we, and our people have suffered, by the said dreadful winds and
storms, which we most humbly acknowledge to be a token of the
divine displeasure, and that it was the infinite mercy of God
that we and our people were not thereby wholly destroyed&mdash;we
have resolved, and do hereby command, that a general and public

subjects) with unfeigned hearts to congratulate the glorious
success of your arms in the victory obtained by your successfull
Generall John Duke of Marleborow over the French and Bavarians
near Hochstet; a defeat so entire, that hardly foreign or English
history can paralell, so seasonable that the safety of the whole
empire was the consequence of it; and upon the distant Danube,
where the English arms never triumphed before: and whilst
reverence makes us approach leisurely to your Majesties Throne,
every day still produces new trophies; the Sea as well as the
Land, Affrica as well as Europe must loudly proclaime Your
Majestie is every where, invincible.&mdash;These are blessings
justly due to your Majesties Piety and Courage, who so steddily
have pursued the example of your glorious Predecessor, that from
his early years, and almost a private station was always the
chiefe opposer of the torrent of France, Popery, and Slavery, and
whose memory will always be valuable in all true English hearts;
were it for nothing else, yet for paving us the establishment of
a Protestant succession in the person of your sacred Majestie,
Notwithstanding which by the treachery of your faithless Ennemys
your Majestie upon your accession found the dreadful powers of
France and Spain united, who singly have in their turns
push&rsquo;d fair for the western monarchy.&nbsp; This would have
shaken any courage less firm than your own, who whilst all Europe
lay gasping waiting for the result of your councell, you
stretched out your powerful arme to support the then tottering
frame of its liberty, and was alone able to preserve it, and in
that ourselves.&nbsp; And whilst your Majestie so carefully
nurses our established church, your charity extends to the whole
Protestant interest of Europe, which must certainly appear very
naturall to your Majestie whilst your capital Enemy prides
himselfe in being the Head of the Roman Catholicks and they in
him.&mdash;May Your Majesties Subjects unite in their
acknowledgements to your Majestie that the last subterfuge of our
conquered Ennemys (our Divisions) may not prevail amongst us; but
that whilst our Armys are so bravely commanded, our Treasury so
frugally expended, our Laws so equally administered&mdash;and
above all, The whole by your Majesties providentiall care so
wisely superintended, Our Religion and Liberty may under your
most auspicious government be immovably secured to us and to our

which will give the reader an opportunity to form his own opinion
of its merits or character.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;June 9. 1706&mdash;The Humble Address of
the mayor, recorder, aldermen, and common-councell of your
Majesties ancient Burgh of King&rsquo;s Lynn.&mdash;May it please
your Majestie&mdash;Having ever since our happy revolution (which
restored our English Constitution) undergone the various events
of a long war with the utmost cheerfullness and alacrity, our
zeal can never slacken (but increase) under your Majesties reign
of wonders, who is raised by Providence to extricate us out of
the greatest difficulties, and to putt a hooke into the nostrills
of that great Leviathan who hath so long sported himself upon our
waters.&mdash;It is your Majesties genius that inspires,
&rsquo;tis your choice that enables your brave generall the Duke
of Marleborow to make our streets thus often resound with the
joyfull noise of victorys.&nbsp; These strokes are master-pieces
not to be found in the Louvre at Versailles.&nbsp; Whilst with
one blow he reduces the treacherous Bavarian and makes him fly
his own country; with the other he drives him out of his French
government too, effectually confirming the just Ban of the
Empire, (where your generall hath so well deserved the prime
dignity) and restores the flourishing Provinces of Brabant and
Spanish Flanders to its rightfull Prince.&nbsp; The haughty
Spaniard will hereby see if they would preserve their unwieldy
monarchy entire, it is your majesties protection they must have
recourse to.&nbsp; But no lest wonderfull are all the rest of the
steps of your Majesties government upon the main continent (even
the farthest parts of Spain nearest France) wee see the large
provinces of Catalonia and Valentia (with ane amasing success
reduc&rsquo;d to their lawful sovereigne), where our brave
Englis&rsquo;h Peterborough&rsquo;s zeale, for the honour of his
Prince and Country hath rivalled even the longest
experience.&nbsp; And as it is as difficult to preserve as gaine,
how have wee seen half a hundred capitall ships reach the length
of the distant Barcelona before the time they almost used to put
to sea.&nbsp; At their approach Lewis&rsquo;s blood chills in the
veins of Anjou and Tholouse.&nbsp; They fly from before us.&nbsp;
Wee hope (the former) to increase the numbers of the French
king&rsquo;s pretended and abdicated Princes, who crye to him for
succour (tho&rsquo; in vain) which might convince Lewis (as
Alexander&rsquo;s wound did him) that notwithstanding the statues
and Panegyricks,) he is not yet arrived at immortality.&mdash;But
our prospects are still more comfortable att home, wee find an
universal calme amongst us, and as one effect of it the nationall
credit advanced to a degree even beyond what the most peaceable
times could boast off, which is the best evidence in the Body
Politick as the face is of health in the body naturall.&nbsp; Wee
are thankfully convinced your Majestie is the best Protector, as
well as the greatest Ornament and Benefactor of our established
Church, and are best Judge of what is for its advantage: and if
any party ffaction (out of a private ambition) should endeavour
to insinuate any groundless ffears, or erect as any other
guarautees (that your Majesties daily actions) as wee are
satisfied it is, endeavouring to allieniate and transfer from
your Majestie the affection of your subjects and their just
depending on your Person, so it is to robb us of our peace and
quiett.&mdash;That your Majestie may be always fear&rsquo;d and
honor&rsquo;d abroad and reverenc&rsquo;d at home, as it shall be
always (in our low sphere) our utmost wishes and endeavours, so
may he be deemed unworthy of the name of ane Englishman that doth
not heartily say Amen.&rdquo;</p>

class="footnote">[885]</a>&nbsp; What occasioned the decay and
demolition of our water-mills seems to have been the want of a
sufficient supply of water to work them, owing, perhaps, partly,
if not chiefly to the neglect of keeping the different
water-courses in due repair, and especially those connected with
the Middleton river.&nbsp; The following articles from the
Hall-books will throw some light on this
subject&mdash;&ldquo;August 29. 1706; ordered the cutting and
opening a trench in the common ditch from Kettlewell to a sluce
at Gannock gate in order to carry the water from thence to the
same water-mills.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again&mdash;&ldquo;Nov. 8.&nbsp;
It is ordered that it be referred to a Committee to state the
case touching the flow and reflow of the salt waters in Middleton
river for the service of the corn water-mills, and the benefite
of continuing or deserting those priviledges to this corporation,
and to inform themselves now far this corporation will be
obliged, in case of deserting that river to the ditching or
scouring the same or any or what part
thereof.&rdquo;&mdash;Again&mdash;Dec. 20.&nbsp; The committees
report is,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>1.&nbsp; We find that the flow and reflow of the
salt-waters for the service of the corn-water-mills is an antient
right and priviledge enjoyed time out of mind by this
corporation, under a fee farme rent of 20<i>s.</i> payable to the
lords of the manor of Gaywood, heretofore the bishop, prior, and
convent of Norwich&mdash;2.&nbsp; That whilst the said corn-mills
did bear a considerable rent the charges of ditching and scouring
the rivers and drains in which these waters had their course,
were easy and supportable, and the said mills were of great
service and benefits to this corporation&mdash;3.&nbsp; That the
rents and profits of the same mills of late years are much
reduced and lessened, and the rivers and drains so silted and
grown up that the charges of ditching and scouring those rivers,
will be greater than the future rents and profits thereof will
compensate.&nbsp; We are therefore of opinion that it will be of
less disadvantage to this town to disanul the said flow and
reflow of the salt waters than to continue the same under the
present great and unavoidable charges of opening the said rivers;
and that the use of the fresh waters constantly descending in
these rivers not being obstructed by the salts, will be of great
advantage to the country adjacent draining by these rivers, and
will also in a great measure be serviceable to the working the
said mills and preserving the said drains and
outfalls.&mdash;4.&nbsp; That in case the said flow and reflow be
deserted, wee are of opinion that the said rivers and drains
ought to be ditched and scoured at the equal charge of all the
lands draining thereby according to the ancient laws and customs
of sewers.&mdash;Signed by Ch. Turner Esq. mayor, Hen.

our book of extracts&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;June 27. 1709.&nbsp; We having taken
several views of the condition of this Harbor and the banks,
walls, and defences thereof, the dolphins and stakes antiently
erected for the security and safe mooring of ships, and of the
dangers of undermining the foundations of the houses and
buildings next the Haven there: It appears to us that in the
space of a few years last past, by the rapid and violent descents
of the waters in the Ebb Tides, the course of the chanell is much
altered and diverted and the deep run brought under the said
Dolphins and stakes, and so near the said banks, walls, and
defences, and the danger of undermining the said foundation daily
more increasing, that the charges of preserving the said Harbour
are become insupportable.&nbsp; Wee are [therefore] of opinion
that it is absolutely necessary that some speedy care be taken
for erecting one or more large Jettys of timber and stone in fitt
places for reducing the chanell to its usuall course, and that
Engineers experienced to such works, be consulted, and endeavours
considered for obtaining ane act of parliament for some
reasonable tax or assessment upon tunnage for the enabling the
performance of such works, and that the vast charges and expences
already laid out on this behalf be inspected and
computed.&mdash;Signed <i>Hon. Chennery</i> mayor, <i>Robt.

<p>Afterwards, under the date of Aug. 29, the same year, it is
added, &ldquo;Capt. Hawley is desired to come down to view the

follows&mdash;&ldquo;Referr&rsquo;d to a Comittee Lord
Townshend&rsquo;s Letter respecting the employing of poor

that of the elder <i>Kinderley</i> also was employed in the same
cause, as appears by the dedication and preface to his
son&rsquo;s volume on the <i>ancient and present state of the
navigation of Lynn</i>, &amp;c.&nbsp; About these times, the
names of Messrs. <i>Steph. Allen</i>, <i>John Cary</i>, and

served in the German or imperial army during a war with the

one of them overpowered and taken prisoner.&nbsp; Upon which he
called out to his comrade, &ldquo;By Jasus, I <i>have caught a
Tartar</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the other,
&ldquo;bring him away then;&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>he wont

<p><a name="footnote912"></a><a href="#citation912"
class="footnote">[912]</a>&nbsp; The gentlemen of this town, with
all their superabundant zeal for the church, ought to consider
how much they owe, for what morality and religion exist here, to
the exertions of those who dissent from that church.&nbsp; Every
candid and discerning person in the town must see and acknowledge
that the labours of these dissenters have very largely
contributed to the reformation of the inhabitants.&nbsp; But for
our dissenting chapels, far more than one half, perhaps three
fourths of our population would have been effectually precluded
from the possibility of being benefited by the public ministry of
the clergy, for want of room or proper accommodation in the
churches.&nbsp; This is a known fact.&nbsp; Must not the labours
of the dissenters therefore be evidently and unquestionably
entitled to the gratitude and encouragement of our rulers, even
if their mode of instruction had <i>not</i> been better
calculated to enlighten the common people than that of the church
ministers?</p>
<p><a name="footnote913"></a><a href="#citation913"
class="footnote">[913]</a>&nbsp; The <i>Harwicks</i> seem to have
been peculiarly unfortunate in being treated unhandsomely and
rudely by some of their townsmen, during their mayoralty.&nbsp;
<i>Richard</i> Harwick was said to be so treated, by
<i>Browne</i>, in 1723, and <i>Charles</i> Harwick now by this
<i>Rudkin</i>.&nbsp; How to account for this, we are unable to
say.&nbsp; The Harwicks might carry themselves with too much
haughtiness, or, on the other hand, with too much condescension;
for the one as well as the other kind of conduct has sometimes
exposed people to rude and unbecoming treatment.&nbsp; However
that was, the fact itself, as above stated, appears no less clear
than remarkable.</p>

books&mdash;&ldquo;Nov. 26. 1731, Mr. Th. Sommersby chosen into
the common councel, in the room of John Rudkin
amoved.&rdquo;&mdash;Sometime previously to the expulsion of
Rudkin, Edw. Bradfield, the Town clerk, was also expelled, or
discharged from his office, as appears by the following notes in
the same books&mdash;&ldquo;August 29. 1729, Ed. Bradfield,
Town-Clerk suspended.&rdquo;&mdash;again . . . &ldquo;Sept. 29.
1729; Ed. Bradfield, Town-Clerk discharged.&rdquo;&mdash;His
offence, or the cause and reason of his discharge is not
mentioned: but by the <i>Epitaph</i> drawn up for him by his
friend Dr. <i>Browne</i>, it would seem not to have been any
thing very honourable or creditable to the corporation.&nbsp;
This Epitaph, as it is of an unusual cast, and in the
doctor&rsquo;s best manner, may be worth preserving, and reads as
follows.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>Behold a rare

<p>This Epitaph is certainly creditable to the feelings and
memory of Sir William Browne.&mdash;Having this occasion to
mention him again, the author begs leave here to correct what he
said above at page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page901">901</a></span> relating to the question, whether
or not he had been complimented with the freedom of this
borough?&nbsp; He has since ascertained that that honour was
actually conferred on him <i>gratis</i>, Febr 3 1717&ndash;18;
which must have been previous to his having incurred the
displeasure of the Hall.&nbsp; Nor can this writer discover that
the same honour was withheld from any <i>physician</i>, who had
settled here for any length of time, before our two present ones:
(only Dr. Hamilton <i>purchased</i> his freedom, but that was, it
seems, before he had received his Doctor&rsquo;s degree.)&nbsp;
Nor yet does this same honour appear to have been withheld from
any of the <i>clergy</i> who were <i>Lecturers</i> here, except
the present Lecturer and his predecessor <i>Eyre</i>.&nbsp; We
know not how to account for this omission on the part of our
corporation, (at a time when the honour itself is daily
decreasing in value,) but from a mere <i>want</i> of
<i>urbanity</i>; and we hope, in what we may have occasion to say
of them hereafter, we shall never have any reason to lay any
thing worse to their charge.</p>

nearly completed one part of their work, and were ready to
congratulate themselves on its impervious, impassable, and
impregnable aspect, a <i>greyhound</i> that followed one of the
gentlemen, making a sudden spring, flew over it in an instant,
which so cooled their ardour, damped their spirits, and
discouraged them, that they had no longer any heart at all to
proceed: for they concluded, that if that greyhound could do so,
the <i>Highlanders</i>, if they came, would not fail to storm
every thing of that kind that might happen to stand in their
way.&mdash;So apprehensive and confident were they for some time
that the rebels would come this way, that they readily gave heed
to every flying and idle report that coincided with that
notion.&nbsp; It was at one time believed, that their vanguard
had nearly reached <i>Wisbeach</i>, and even that some of their
scouts or spies were actually in <i>Marshland</i>.&nbsp; The last
belief arose from the circumstance of two travelling Scotchmen
happening then to pass through Marshland, whom every body took to
be no other than rebel spies.&nbsp; A strong party was sent from
Lynn to take them up, who, among other things, questioned them,
if they had <i>arms</i>?&nbsp; To which they answered,
&ldquo;Yes, they had <i>twa</i>,&rdquo; lifting up both their
arms at the same time.</p>

desirous to do ample justice, and give all due commendation to
the persevering and unwearied exertions of the different
descriptions of our Lynn dissenters.&nbsp; They have certainly
done much good, here as well as elsewhere.&nbsp; After all, it
must be allowed and confessed that the miserable <i>bigotry</i>,
<i>illiberality</i> and <i>intolerance</i>, which they have often
discovered, and particularly <i>on a recent occasion</i>,
constitute a vast and sad drawback from the merit of their
exertions, and the praise to which their labours are
entitled.&nbsp; But on this head we shall be more explicit, when
we come to the <i>present state</i> of the town.</p>
<p><a name="footnote935"></a><a href="#citation935"
class="footnote">[935]</a>&nbsp; That the <i>evangelical
clergy</i> and their <i>patrons</i> should be at all alarmed, at
the growth, or progress of methodism, seems not a little singular
and strange, considering that they themselves are looked upon as
one sort of methodists, and have certainly and evidently
contributed, in a very large measure, to the increase and
prosperity of that sect.&nbsp; They, sorely, did not mean or wish
to make their hearers dissenters, but the spirit of their system
and the drift of their ministry appear to have a strong tendency
that way.</p>
<p><a name="footnote936"></a><a href="#citation936"
class="footnote">[936]</a>&nbsp; At Lynn, and some other places,
the <i>Wesleyans</i> alone bear the name of <i>Methodists</i>:
whereas the <i>Whitefieldians</i> are here denominated
<i>Independents</i>, which name they have likewise assumed in
many other places.&nbsp; In some of the western parts the name of
Methodists is given only to them, and the others are called
<i>Wesleyans</i>, and sometimes <i>Wesleys</i>: but on this
subject we will say more hereafter.</p>
<p><a name="footnote937"></a><a href="#citation937"
class="footnote">[937]</a>&nbsp; Whether it will so happen or
not, it is certain that the <i>methodist Constitution</i> is well
worth the attention of the statesman and philosopher, as well as
the historian.&nbsp; It is admirably calculated for making
numerous proselytes, and becoming the predominant religion of a
country&mdash;especially that of the <i>Wesleyan</i> community;
whose whole plan and organization discover exquisite skill and
judgment, with a most deep and accurate knowledge of human
nature.&nbsp; In all which respects John Wesley appears no way
inferior to any of the heads of our modern orders or sects, from
Francis and Dominic down to Emanuel Swedenburg and Joanna
Southcote; not excepting Ignatius Loyola, Martin Luther, John
Calvin, or even Fox and Penu and count Zinzendorff.</p>

further says, that during the said electioneering tumult,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;the insults on the T&mdash;rs family, the
ladies not excepted, were prodigious, especially from young
*&mdash;*, who exceeded every thing that was heard of, to my old
lady and the margeries.&nbsp; The poor madams zealously espousing
S. J&mdash;n&rsquo;s cause were most grievously abused by him and
others, with their s&mdash;rs drunkenness, their own fat
a&mdash;s, and even much worse upon their spitting in young
*&rsquo;s face, in the heat of their passion out of a window, on
the Election day.&nbsp; So that they have had fevers.&mdash;Dr.
B&mdash; has declared eternal war, in those very words, against
every branch of the T&mdash;s family, and supported Mr. F&rsquo;s
interest with the rage of a madman: his W. and D. did the same,
and are yet the most billingsgate beasts imaginable.&mdash;A. T.
purely for the sake of mischief reconciled himself to his Bro.
and supported his cause with all the might of his tongue and
purse.&mdash;S&mdash;*&mdash; after going about the town with the
gentlemen to promote L&mdash;d O. and S. J&rsquo;s interest, upon
Mr. F&rsquo;s breaking his promise he had made not to meddle,
turned to him, and was as violent as any body.&mdash;T * voted
for S. J. but did him privately all the mischief he could, and
went out of town one day, that his W. might entertain F at
Supper.&nbsp; J. * was a fury, and his W. the queen of furies,
and to this hour is fit only for Bedlam.&nbsp; All others stood
tight to S. J.&nbsp; But he and his * have had all their faults
ript up and laid open.&mdash;At length Monday came; and after an
expense of near 2000<i>l.</i> on each side, the dear bought poll
stood thus W. 199.&nbsp; T. 184 F. 131.&mdash;There were players
in town at the time; so the triumphant party gave their friends
an entertainment of that sort.&nbsp; To ridicule D&mdash;r
B&mdash; the <i>Busy Body</i> was the play, and a farce was added
called the <i>Mock D&mdash;r</i>, which <i>mock Dr.</i> was
dressed as like Dr. B&mdash; as could be.&nbsp; F&mdash;&rsquo;s
people on their part tho&rsquo; beaten, would shew they had good
hearts; so they bespoke <i>Pasquin</i>, which is, you know,
written to ridicule corporation Elections; there is a m&mdash;r
and m&mdash;r&mdash;ss &amp;c.&nbsp; They took care to dress the
m&mdash;r and cripple him, so as to resemble poor P&mdash;, and
Madam m&mdash;r&mdash;ss was most specially drunk.&nbsp; The
shouting and insolence were prodigious, calling out, F&mdash; for
ever! between the acts, and drinking his health throughout the
house, and ending with an Epilogue made by Dr. B&mdash; comparing
Sr. J&mdash;n to <i>Tom Thumb</i>.&nbsp; They keep up a most
indecent rage yet, and swear they&rsquo;ll never have done, till
they&rsquo;ve thrown out Sr. J&mdash;n.&nbsp; F. is coming again
in a few days, and here&rsquo;s to be dainty-doings.&nbsp; Upon
the whole, they say, Sr. J&mdash;n was brought in upon L&mdash;d
O&rsquo;s shoulders, which, tho&rsquo; better than not brought in
at all, sits not pleasantly upon his stomach, any more than the
expense of 2000<i>l.</i> suits his temper and pocket.&mdash;I
have been guilty of an unpardonable omission in saying nothing of
your friend madam M&mdash;x&mdash;n, who espoused Sr.
J&mdash;n&rsquo;s cause with mighty warmth, and did him great
service.&nbsp; She kept open house for all freemen, and waited on
&rsquo;em herself, and look&rsquo;d exactly like a woman that
keeps a booth in a Fair, with, roast pork, bottled ale, cider,
&amp;c.&nbsp; When her husband was at home, she went abroad to
outlyers, with presents, to keep them tight: and several of
&rsquo;em she had at bed and board in her house, for fear of the
enemy.&nbsp; Dr. B&mdash; came to her, and demanded the release
of the men: she withstood him, and defended her castle, as
bravely as <i>Joan of Arc</i> could have done, had she been
raised from the dead, against the D&mdash;r, parson M&mdash;y,
and other hussars, who were scouring every hole and corner of the
town.&nbsp; The close of her gallant conduct was in free
conference, or rather a pitched battle with
Dr&mdash;B&mdash;&rsquo;s W. upon what had passed, which was of
some hours continuance, and better worth all the money you have
in your pocket, to have seen and heard, than <i>Pasquin</i>, or
the <i>Busy Body</i> was worth 6<i>d.</i>&mdash;Next to this
Heroine deserves to be mentioned <i>Harvey</i> the
&rsquo;Pothecary, who because Sr. J&mdash; gave a relation of his
a place lately, turned against him, and against his own express
promise; drank himself into a fever, and is dead and
buried.&nbsp; He has left all he had to his wife, who seems very
glad of her loss, as well as her gain.&nbsp; <i>Nic. Elstobb</i>
was wild on the same side, and raved till he spit blood, and was
at death&rsquo;s door, and is not far from it at this time.&nbsp;
<i>Martin Sand&mdash;r</i> on the other side lost his senses
without a joke, and was given over for a week, but is now as well
as ever.&mdash;There never was such a funeral at Lynn as
Harvey&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The number of persons invited was very
great, but the volunteers made the chief figure.&nbsp; All
F&rsquo;s party met at the Dog, and joined the procession, going
2 and 2, and returned to the same place, in the same manner,
where they spent the night in drinking F for ever, and to
Harvey&rsquo;s pious memory.&mdash;The next night after the
<i>Busy Body</i> was played, my L&mdash;d and S. J. gave a Ball
to all the freemen&rsquo;s wives and daughters&mdash;After a few
dances by the better sort of Ladies they sat down, and L&mdash;d
*&rsquo;s Son, (who rode for his cousin,) S. J, the C&mdash;r,
Mr. B&mdash; and Sr. Wm. H&mdash;b&mdash;d and the rest took
shopkeepers wives and daughters, and twirl&rsquo;d &rsquo;em
about all the rest of the night.&nbsp; This gave great
content.&mdash;In return for Mr. M&mdash;x&mdash;n&rsquo;s seal
in S. J&mdash;&rsquo;s service, the other party have played him a
trick, by getting Johnson R&mdash;s D&mdash;r, who has a right in
what remains above the mortgage in M&mdash;x&mdash;n&rsquo;s
House, to set it to sale; and so, by underhand management, they
forced him to buy it at a dear rate, or he must have gone out of
it.&rdquo;</p>

class="footnote">[962]</a>&nbsp; The ancient usage seems to have
been for the mayor to name and authorize <i>twelve</i> of his
brethren of the Hall to elect two burgesses to represent the town
in parliament.&nbsp; Hence we read in an old record, that in the
year 1487 <i>Robert Pillye</i>, then mayor, called and empowered
the following twelve men to elect two persons to represent this
borough in the parliament which was to meet that year: viz.&nbsp;
John Massingham, John Bilney, Tho. Carter, Wm. Yates, Robt.
Powdich, Andr. Woley, John Thorisby, Hen. Gardyner, Robt. Umfrey,
Tho. Symkenson, John Trunche, and Tho. Archer: who accordingly
chose <i>Robert Thorisbye</i> and <i>John Tygo</i>.&mdash;Two
years before (1485,) <i>Robert Braybroke</i> and <i>William
Munke</i> had been chosen in like manner:&mdash;and the year
following, (1488,) in the mayoralty of <i>John Tyge</i>, twelve
men, called and authorised by him, chose <i>John Gryndell</i> and
<i>Thomas Carter</i> to sit in the parliament called that
year.&mdash;It seems by this that elections were then very
frequent; annual perhaps, or nearly so: and each parliament
continuing but one session.&mdash;The same old record mentions
several other subsequent elections, always made by 12 persons
called thereto by the mayor&mdash;only once, but it does not
appear in what year, he seems to have nominated but <i>eight</i>,
which eight are said to have called unto them four more, so
making up the number of 12; which 12 chose for burgesses of
parliament <i>Robt. Braybroke</i> and <i>John Beels</i>.&nbsp;
This might be in 1486&mdash;If so, we have here an account of
four annual parliaments at that period.&mdash;Let us not,
however, blame our ancestors for leaving the election of their
members in the hands of 12 persons; for we do not appear to have
at all mended the matter yet: our efficient or real electors are
even now less than 12.</p>

and go on, the commissioners will have to borrow money to a vast
amount, which they will probably, not find a very easy matter, as
other fen projects, such as those of the <i>river Nene</i> and
<i>Feltwell District</i> especially, have turned out so miserably
unpropitious to the respective creditors; that the interest of
their money is now many years in arrears, with but little
prospect of its being ever again liquidated.&nbsp; The
<i>Nene</i> commissioners are so much above their business, and
so regardless of the rights of their creditors, that they
sometimes will not deign to meet, so much as once a year, to
examine the state of their finances and see if any thing can be
spared towards the payment of their debts.&mdash;As to the
gentlemen, or commissioners of the &ldquo;<i>Feltwell</i> new fen
district,&rdquo; they, some years ago, thought proper to
represent themselves in a state of insolvency, and proposed that
their creditors should advance at the rate of ten per centum of
the money in their hands towards obtaining a new act of
parliament to increase the drainage taxes, and so enable them
thenceforth to pay interest regularly.&nbsp; The money was
advanced, and the new act obtained, but not a shilling of
interest has been yet advanced, under pretence that all the money
is wanted for repairs and drainage improvements, &amp;c.&nbsp;
How far all this is honest or honourable we need not say; but
that it will not fail to make some people in future more cautious

thus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lynn, May 11. 1802.&nbsp; Thursday last
being the day appointed for the public reading of his
majesty&rsquo;s proclamation of peace in this town, the morning
was ushered in by the ringing of bells and other demonstrations
of joy.&nbsp; At noon the Lynn Loyal Volunteers, commanded by
major Everard, paraded in the Tuesday market place.&nbsp; Soon
after, the mayor, accompanied by the recorder, aldermen,
common-council-men, and most of the inhabitants, proceeded in
front of the line to the market cross, when the town-crier read
the proclamation of peace.&nbsp; The Volunteers then fired a
<i>feu de joie</i>, which was succeeded by reiterated shouts of
applause from every person present, the band striking up
&lsquo;Rule Britannia.&rsquo;&nbsp; Major Everard then addressed
the corps, and after thanking them for their zeal in defence of
their country, read to them the thanks of both houses of
parliament for their meritorious past services, and informed them
they were now to be disbanded, conformably to the regulation of
government, with a reward the most gratifying, their
sovereign&rsquo;s approbation of their conduct.&nbsp; The
noncommissioned officers and privates were then severally
presented with a pecuniary donation, in lieu of a public
entertainment.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus it appears that the conduct of these volunteers gained
the approbation and applause not only of their fellow citizens or
townsmen, but even of the higher orders of the nation, up to the
very throne.</p>

class="footnote">[979]</a>&nbsp; The year 1797 was also
distinguished in Norfolk for two great political meetings held
there in the spring of that year, of which the Norfolk
Remembrancer gives the following account.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;April 25th. a county meeting was held on
the Castle Hill (Norwich,) in the open air, and a petition,
praying his majesty to dismiss his present ministers, as the most
effectual means of reviving the national credit and restoring
peace, was moved by Mr. Fellowes, seconded by Mr. Rolfe,
supported by Lord Albemarle, Mr. Coke, Mr. Mingay, Mr. Plumptre,
and Mr. Trafford, and almost unanimously adopted.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Had the whole nation done the same it might have proved of
incalculable benefit.&nbsp; But three days after another meeting
was convened by the opposite party, to counteract the effect of
the former.&nbsp; At this meeting, (according to the work just
referred to,)</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;a dutiful and loyal address to the king was
moved by Sir T. Beevor, and seconded by R. Milles Esq. and
afterwards numerously signed by the nobility, gentry, and
freeholders, expressive of their reliance on the measures adopted
by the ministers for obtaining a safe and honourable peace, and
of their readiness to defend with their lives and fortunes, the
religion, laws, and constitution of their country.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These swaggering and blustering life-and-fortune men have had
their day, and a pretty long one it has proved.&nbsp; If the
nation be not yet quite tired of their swaggering, and sick at
heart of their system of war, bloodshed, violence, and endless
expenditure, it seems high time it should.&nbsp; We surely,
ought, to be fully convinced, by this time, that the politics of
their opponents, so long decried among us, are infinitely better

class="footnote">[982]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; During the whole
continuance of this Paper scarce any thing more remarkable
appeared among its contents than the memorable controversy about
the termination of the century, which caused a sad division among
our wise men of that period.&nbsp; Some affirmed that the century
actually ended with that year, 1799; while others insisted that
it could not end till the conclusion of the following year, for
this plain reason, that <i>ninety nine</i> could not possibly
make one <i>hundred</i>.&nbsp; In short, this controversy seems
to have exhibited our wise men as somewhat akin to the wise men
of Gotham.</p>
<p><a name="footnote984"></a><a href="#citation984"
class="footnote">[984]</a>&nbsp; Of these two addresses the
former, according to the <i>Lynn Packet</i>, was worded as
follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>To the King&rsquo;s most excellent
majesty</i>: The humble Address of the Mayor, Aldermen, and
Common-council of the borough of <span class="smcap">King&rsquo;s
Lynn</span>, in the county of Norfolk, in Council
assembled.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Most gracious
sovereign</span>: We your Majesty&rsquo;s Loyal Subjects, the
Mayor, aldermen, and common-council of the borough of
King&rsquo;s Lynn, in the county of Norfolk, humbly beg leave to
bear this public testimony of our horror and indignation at the
late nefarious attempt upon a life so highly important to the
welfare of these realms.&nbsp; We most cordially congratulate,
not only your majesty, but all friends to our country, on your
providential escape from danger so imminent; and beg leave to
express our earnest wishes and prayers, that your majesty may
long continue to reign over a free and happy people.&mdash;Given
<i>under our Common-Seal</i>, <i>at our Guildhall</i>, <i>the</i>
21<i>st.</i> <i>day of May</i>, <i>in the year of our Lord</i>
1800.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Address from the <i>inhabitants</i> was somewhat longer,
but to the same effect, though differently worded.&nbsp; The
former mentioned the horrid act as having excited the
<i>indignation</i>, and the latter the <i>detestation</i> of the
addressers, neither of which could be very proper as applied to
the conduct of a madman.&nbsp; The outrageous conduct of a
maniac, may excite horror; but it is not easy to conceive how it
can excite either indignation or detestation.&nbsp; Before we
dismiss this subject we may just observe that <i>Hadfield</i>,
<i>Brothers</i>, and <i>Margaret Nicholson</i>, were not the only
personages who, in the course of this reign, were moved and
impelled by the spirit of insanity to pay very extraordinary
attention to the sovereign.</p>

great accession of honour to our town in 1807, by the addition of

the common-wealth and protectorate.</p>

is an old quarto MS. or record, evidently extracted from an older
one, or from the Hall-books, for the use, it seems, of the
clergy, and probably by some of that body, as it has passed
through that channel, and is written by different hands.&nbsp; In
this record the following notices of Mr. Arrowsmith
occur&mdash;</p>

<p>[It appears that the place of minister of St. Nicholas&rsquo;
was then preferable to that of St. Margaret&rsquo;s; otherwise
Mr. Arrowsmith, no doubt, would have had the offer of the
latter]&mdash;again&mdash;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>He was succeeded about a fortnight after, by <i>Mr. Thomas
Hoogan</i>.&nbsp; But Mr Arrowsmith continued long after to be
highly respected here, as appears by their applying to him when
in want of ministers, and accepting those whom he
recommended.&nbsp; Mr. W. Falkner, Fellow of Peter House, came
here as late as 1658, upon his recommendation, and that of Dr.
<i>Tuckney</i>.</p>
<p><a name="footnote993"></a><a href="#citation993"
class="footnote">[993]</a>&nbsp; We are assured that Dr. Tho.
Goodwin, afterwards the memorable president of Magdalen College,
Oxford, was at this time lecturer of Trinity Church, and fellow
of Catherine Hall, in Cambridge, of which Arrowsmith, who was
afterwards successfully invited to Lynn, was then likewise a
fellow: there can therefore be no doubt of his being the very
person who was now applied to from this town.&nbsp; (See
Aikin&rsquo;s Biography.)</p>
<p><a name="footnote994"></a><a href="#citation994"
class="footnote">[994]</a>&nbsp; Granger speaks of him as
follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>John Goodwin</i>, minister of Coleman
Street, was a man who made more noise in the world than any
person of his age, rank, and profession.&nbsp; He had the
hardiness to introduce Arminianism among the Calvinists, which he
bravely and jealously defended, both in his sermons and
writings.&nbsp; It is hard to say whether he displayed more
courage in attacking or repelling the enemy.&nbsp; It is certain
he had a very powerful body to deal with, as it was said that
<i>he was a man by himself</i>: <i>was against every man</i>,
<i>and had every man almost against him</i>.&nbsp; His genius
seemed to be adapted to polemical divinity, and to an age of
faction and tumult.&nbsp; He was appointed by the council of war
to attend upon Charles I. a little before his execution.&nbsp;
This was deemed an insult upon fallen majesty; as no man more
eagerly promoted, or more zealously defended the murder of the
king.&nbsp; His discourses and writings on this subject were well
remembered at the restoration; but it was also remembered, that
he had sown the seeds of division among the sectaries, which is
supposed to have saved his life.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was educated at Cambridge, and his sermons were much
admired for their elegance and erudition.&nbsp; Brit. Biogr. 6.
378.&mdash;He died in 1665, aged 72.</p>
<p><a name="footnote995"></a><a href="#citation995"
class="footnote">[995]</a>&nbsp; Of his matrimonial adventure we
have met with the following anecdote&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The gentlewoman who afterwards was his
wife, coming with her two elder sisters to hear him preach at
<i>Hareby</i>, a village not far from <i>Bullingbrook</i>, the
clerk, after sermon, insinuating himself into their company,
asked them, which of them could like such a man as Mr. H. for a
husband?&nbsp; The two elder declared against it, (though they
could not but commend his preaching,) and gave their reasons
drawn from the poor circumstances ministers&rsquo; widows were
often left in: but the younger said she should think herself
happy if she might have such a man, though she begged her bread
with him.&nbsp; This was carried to Mr. H and she became his
wife.&nbsp; She survived him [ten years] but never wanted while
she lived.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>Nonconf. Mem.</i> vol. 2.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="footnote996"></a><a href="#citation996"
class="footnote">[996]</a>&nbsp; Mr. <i>Palmer</i> dates the
commencement of his residence and ministry here in 1647, in which
he is mistaken, as appears both from the document above referred
to, and also from the old parish-book of South Lynn, which prove
beyond all doubt, that he was here in 1646.&mdash;The former
contains the following curious memoranda&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oct. 2. 1646: ord. yt Wedn. 14th be a day
set apart for public thanksgiving to God for his so mercifully
freeing this town fr ye contagious disease of the
<i>Plague</i>.&nbsp; Notice to be given to sevl minrs by Mr. ald.

sevl. ministers of this Town, viz. <i>Mr. Almond</i>, <i>Mr.
Hoogan</i>, <i>Mr. Toll</i>, <i>Mr. Leech</i>, and <i>Mr.
Horne</i> if he please, shall every one of them be intreated in
his turn weekly at the Hour appointed to pray every morning
before the Hall here with the company of this House by the space
of a quarter of an hour or thereabout; and that every one of the
aldermen or comn. Counsell that shall at any time be absent frm.
such Prayer shall pay for his respective fine or brogue
6<i>d.</i> to the use of the Poor, and yt. ys. order as to the
sd. payment of 6<i>d.</i> for ye sd. absence from prayer shall be
inserted in the Table of ancient orders.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;again&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;9, Dec. 1646: Whereas <i>Mr. Almond</i>,
<i>Mr. Hoogan</i>, <i>Mr. Toll</i>, and <i>Mr. Leech</i>, ye now
ministers of this Burgh did lately present a Petition unto ys.

amongst ourselves by them and <i>Mr. Horne</i>: and this day 3 of

Petition was now plainly read, wherein were some dark sentences
and words not well understood, whereupon ys House hath intreated
and nominated <i>Mr. Hudson</i>, <i>Mr. Slany</i>, <i>Mr.

</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;again&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;14. Dec. 1646: Whereas the last Hall day

Committee to consider thereof and certify the several

class="footnote">[999]</a>&nbsp; Some of them are controversial,
in answer to Dr. Owen, Dr. Kendal, Mr. Grantham, &amp;c.&nbsp;
Others are funeral sermons preached at different times, at Lynn
and other parts of Norfolk: one is a narrative of the penitent
behaviour of <i>Rose Warne of Lynn</i>, a condemned malefactor;
another is a Farewell to his parishioners at the time of his
ejection in 1662; another a <i>Poem</i>, entitled <i>The Divine
Wooer</i>, at the end of which is a long Epitaph drawn up by him
for his friend and parishioner, Thomas Lilly, Great Great
Grandfather of our Sir Martin Browne Folkes.&nbsp; Most of the
rest are pious practical discourses, all very creditable to his
memory.&mdash;From the <i>Farewell to his Parishioners</i>, it
appears that the income of his vicarage was 80<i>l.</i> a year,
equal we suppose to 500<i>l.</i> of our money.&nbsp; That income
he sacrificed for conscience&rsquo; sake.</p>

Magdalen fall, which is about half a mile from Magdalen bridge,
on the Marshland side, there was found about 16 foot, within

<p><a name="footnote1010"></a><a href="#citation1010"
class="footnote">[1010]</a>&nbsp; They run thus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Orders to be observed at the Society when
met together&mdash;1. That there be a meeting of the several
members every Lord&rsquo;s day evening, after divine service, for
religious conference, to be managed in manner following, viz. One
of the Stewards with the whole society kneeling, to read the
Collect for the second Sunday in Advent, adding thereunto any
particular Collect according to his discretions (but he shall
make choice of no other but those appointed for Sundays and
holidays) and if a chapter be read out of the N. Test, then the
Society to discourse of the contents of that chapter, aiming
thereby each to improve himself in the undertaking thereof, and
in the more lively application thereof to his own heart and
conscience, and to render the influence more powerful to the mind
both of himself and his brethren.&mdash;That every member at his
going away, according to his ability, put what he please into the
poor-box, which is heartily wished may be done not grudgingly or
of necessity, but with joy and alacrity, for God loveth a
cheerful giver: After which to conclude with two Collects, one of
the Steward&rsquo;s choice, and the last to be that in the
Communion Service, (<i>Prevent us O Lord</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i>)&nbsp; Moreover, beside the forementioned general
method of reading and discoursing the scriptures in order, any
member hath the liberty to raise any argument of a spiritual or
religious nature, provided it be not above our reach and
capacity, nor leading to doubtful disputations, but such as may
conduce to general benefit and advantage, to counselling the
doubtful, and instructing the ignorant, confirming the weak, and
encouraging one another to run with patience the race that is set
before us.&nbsp; But matters of controversy to be avoided,
especially state affairs, as not belonging to us, who pretend to
be instructed by that grace of God that teacheth us to be holy
without blame before him in love.&nbsp; Wherefore upon deliberate
consideration, reflecting upon the confusions and distractions
that have been raised by societies on such occasions, it is
ordered with full consent, that whosoever shall pretend to start
any thing of debate or controversy concerning state affairs,
after the first or second admonition, shall be excluded from the
society: also all discourse of matters of trade, or other
temporal concerns to be forborne.&mdash;2<i>ndly</i>, that every
respective member shall have liberty to recommend an object of
charity to the Stewards, to whom a satisfactory account being
given of the particular circumstances of those unto whom they,
with the consent of the rest of the society, or the greater part
of them, shall give out of the aforesaid collections as necessity
shall require.&mdash;3<i>rdly</i>, That every one that is absent
from the society at their meeting together, if on a frivolous
occasion, such as shews any backwardness to attend, or a mean and
slight esteem for the society in conformity to these rules and
orders, shall incur the penalty of 6<i>d.</i> to be paid into the
bank for defraying the necessary charges of the society, for the
convenience of meeting; and if a Steward, one shilling: but if
any person&rsquo;s absence appears to be involuntary, as from a
master&rsquo;s restraint upon a servant, or otherwise, not
proceeding from sloth or backwardness, a sufficient answer being
given to the Steward who shall enquire the cause, the said answer
shall suffice for his absence: but if any one be absent four
times together without a very sufficient cause, he is to be
looked upon as dissaffected to the society until he gives the
Stewards satisfactory reasons for his said
<i>absence</i>.&mdash;4<i>thly</i>, That upon the Lord&rsquo;s
day next before Whitsunday there shall be an <i>election of
Stewards</i> for the year ensuing, to be made in manner
following, viz. Every member of the Society to put into a bason
two tickets, whereon are written the names of the two persons he
desires may be stewards: that is to say, the one name on the one,
and the other on the other, each of the present stewards to have
duplicate votes, each putting in four tickets, having on two of
them the names of the one, and on the other two the names of the
other person they prefer for stewards: then the tickets being
told over by the old stewards, those two persons whose names are
written on the greatest number of tickets are the Stewards elect;
and if at any time an equality shall happen, then the
determination to be made by lot.&mdash;5<i>thty</i>, That for the
admitting a new member into the Society it is requisite to be
introduced by one of the members, who is to accompany him into
the Society at their usual meeting, where giving an account of
the knowledge he hath of his life and conversation, if approved
of by the Stewards and the rest of the Society, the rules and
orders to be read to him; and after <i>one month</i>, if none of
the society make objection against it, he is to be admitted, by
subscribing his name to these rules and orders, expressing his
approbation of them and resolution to live up to
them.&mdash;6<i>thly</i>, That six times a year every member meet
at St. Margaret&rsquo;s Church to take the holy sacrament
together, extent upon unavoidable hinderance.&mdash;7<i>thly</i>,
That the major part of the society shall upon any necessary
occasion have power to make a new rule or order with the
approbation of a minister of the Church of England, which shall
be equally binding with the present upon every member of the
Society.&mdash;8<i>thly</i>, That the rules and orders be read
over at least six times every year at the usual meeting of the
Society, and every member have liberty to take a copy
thereof.&mdash;9<i>thly</i>, That the person who hath the
greatest number of lots next the Stewards, shall be deputy in the
absence of one of the Stewards.&mdash;<i>These are the Rules and
Orders of a Religious Society in King&rsquo;s Lynn</i>, <i>under
the patronage of the reverend Doctor Littel</i>, <i>Anno
Domini</i> 1704.&rdquo;</p>

upon its character and its objects.&nbsp; Such a society in every
parish would be no way dangerous to either church or state.</p>

class="footnote">[1015a]</a>&nbsp; It must not here be concealed,
that his reputed heterodoxy, especially in regard to the
Athanasian trinity, might also be among the causes, if it was not
indeed the very chief cause of his failure in the point of
ecclesiastical preferment.&nbsp; That he was decidedly averse to
Athanasianism, and made no secret of that aversion, is very well
known; a remarkable instance of which was related by his son Dr.
Edmd. Pyle in a letter to one of his female friends, dated August
4. 1747; a copy of which has fallen into the hands of the present
writer.&nbsp; The passage alluded to is as follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My F&mdash;r has been excessive hoarse and
stuffed and oppressed on the lungs, and after physic had in vain
attempted his relief, he went abroad, the weather being fine, to
view his new ch&mdash;h, <a name="citation1015b"></a><a
href="#footnote1015b" class="citation">[1015b]</a> where they are
putting up a magnificent p&mdash;lp&mdash;t, as the finishing
stroke.&nbsp; There the sight of the Tr&mdash;ty in Un&mdash;ty
emblematically displayed in the front pannel of the said
p&mdash;l&mdash;p&mdash;t put him into such a passion, that you
would have sworn, that with distemper and indignation he must
have been suffocated: but G&mdash;d be praised nature got the
better both of the m&mdash;st&mdash;y and the disease, and the
conflict produced, what medicines could not, a free and large
expectoration, which was succeeded by a fit of as clear and
audible raving, as a man would wish to hear from a sound
protestant divine, on so provoking an occasion.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter-writer to be sure was an arch and wicked dog; but
there can be no doubt of his statement being founded on fact: and
when it is considered how their reputed heterodoxy affected
Clarke, Whiston, and others of Pyle&rsquo;s eminent
contemporaries, it will not appear very strange that his rewards
were not equal to his merits, or that his preferments were few
and inconsiderable.</p>

class="footnote">[1017]</a>&nbsp; The correspondence between
these two eminent men did not close here.&nbsp; It is certain
that some letters afterwards passed between them, as appears from
the fragment of Mr. Pyle&rsquo;s answer to one he had received
from the primate, and which reads thus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I no sooner received the great favour of
your Grace&rsquo;s kind and good Letter than I wrote to the
person intimated therein, and deferred my dutiful answer to it no
longer than till I was enabled to acquaint you with his truly
filial reply, that he should never find greater pleasure than
that of complying with every desire of a father, and the
honorable friends of that father.&mdash;Meantime I am sorry for
the ill state of my friend <i>C&mdash;st&mdash;l</i>, which gives
occasion to this affair.&nbsp; I loved the man: my Sons honoured
him much.&nbsp; I thank your Grace for your very good remembrance
of me and my Sou.&nbsp; Age, my Lord, confines me at home, when
yet good providence blesses me with eyes and faculties, still
enabling me to read, and even to preach once a day
generally.&nbsp; I read every thing and make use of the glorious
prerogative of private judgment, the birth-right of
protestants.&nbsp; I pass free sentiment upon <i>Mddltn</i>, and
on all his opponents stronger or weaker.&nbsp; So I shall upon
what he is going to say on the only piece of that great man of
L&mdash; that ever gave me pleasure.&mdash;I read
<i>Disquisitions</i>, and when I&rsquo;ve done fall to my prayers
and wishes, that the good thing desired may be put into the hands
of the able, knowing, and impartial, that no
church-<i>tinkers</i> may be suffered to mend some few holes and
leave others open, at which some vital part of the noble
christian scheme may run out and be lost.&nbsp; But no wish of
mine is so ardent as that your Grace may live with that excellent
[mind <a name="citation1018"></a><a href="#footnote1018"
class="citation">[1018]</a>] of <i>Tlltsn</i>, which is in you,
to preside in, to direct this same good thing, and bring it to
perfection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of the residue of this letter we know nothing: this part of it
sufficiently shews whereabout Mr. P. and the Primate stood as to
the points afterwards agitated in the <i>Confessional
&amp;c.</i>&nbsp; This epistle is supposed to have been written
about 1753, three years before the death of Mr. P. and four years
before that of the Abp. than whom it does not appear that a
worthier prelate ever occupied the See of Canterbury.</p>

1742 from the same respectable prelate, to the same

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I find by the direction of one of your

well know, has more sense than to adorn the outside of his
letters in that manner.&mdash;I remember a story of a clergyman
of great form in <i>Surry</i>, who directed a post letter to
<i>Abp. Sancroft</i>&mdash;<i>To his Grace</i>, <i>my Lord Abp.
of Canterbury</i>, <i>Primate of all England and
Metropolitan</i>:&mdash;which letter a man famous for imitating
hands happened to see brought to the post-office at <i>Epsom</i>,
and finding a little room left after the word

great wrath in old Sancroft, and a thorough reprimand to the poor

<p><a name="footnote1024"></a><a href="#citation1024"
class="footnote">[1024]</a>&nbsp; Of those letters of his which
have fallen in this writer&rsquo;s way all are of a date
posterior to his removal from this town, except that which
contains the account of the contested election in 1747, of which
we have already given large extracts.&mdash;Of the rest the most
remarkable is dated 24. July 1756, at Chelsea, where the Bp. of
Winchester has a town house, with whom he then resided as his
chaplain.&nbsp; Who his correspondent was does not appear; but he
writes to him as follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dear Sir, I returned to this place a few
days ago from Winch&mdash;r, after taking possession of a warm
stall in the Cathedral, and a very good house in the close.&nbsp;
My going thither was delayed a fortnight, by a feverish disorder,
attended with some very odd and disagreeable circumstances of
inflamation, from which I thank God I am very well
recovered.&nbsp; I find that as my constitution is, I must, now
and then, sacrifice something in point of health, to the plenty,
that flows in this noble house.&nbsp; However I am not worse upon
the whole, than when I lived in Norfolk: in that respect and all
others I am sure I am a <i>thousand times better</i>.&nbsp;
Winch&mdash;r and all the large towns in that county were full of
<i>Hessian troops</i>, whose appearance and sober behaviour was
pleasing.&nbsp; I saw them in several different
circumstances.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">First</span> In their
military <i>Exercise</i>, out of the City, in a spacious plain on
the top of a hill, every fine morning.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Secondly</span>.&nbsp; At their <i>devotions</i>,
on Sundays, in the Body of the Cathedral; which was a most grave
and edifying sight.&nbsp; Their service, (both of such as are
<i>Lutherans</i>, and of others of them that are
<i>Calvinists</i>,) is in the way of our
<i>Dissenters</i>&mdash;1<i>st.</i> a <i>psalm</i>, very long, in
which every Soldier bore his part; each having a book, and
behaving in that, and the other parts of the service, with all
possible decency and attention.&nbsp; I saw about 700 each time
that I was present.&nbsp; They sing very well.&nbsp; The psalm
was set by a Serjeant of Granadiers, a noble stately fellow; who
had a vast pair of whiskers like birch brooms.&nbsp; All their
granadiers wear this distinction in their faces.&nbsp; When the
psalm was ended, a very solemn divine (tho&rsquo; he had no
whiskers) in a black cloak, gave us a sermon in their language;
after a prayer, which ended with the <i>Lord&rsquo;s</i> Prayer;
at which they all went down on their knees on the floor.&nbsp;
The preacher used no great action, but he had a very great voice,
great earnestness, and was in a great sweat.&nbsp; Then followed
another psalm, much shorter than the first, and all was closed
with a prayer shorter also than the former.&mdash;There was a
Collection of money, but for what purpose I know not
certainly.&nbsp; There were few of the common-people but gave
something.&nbsp; It is said to be made for the preacher&rsquo;s
service, by some; others say it has relation to the Sacrament,
which they receive monthly; but I saw not the administration of
it.&nbsp; The generals and officers were all present and behaved
with all seriousness.&nbsp; The officers are very genteel and
frugal; yet generous enough to give the ladies of the place a
Ball once a week.&mdash;Another circumstance I saw them in was at
a Ball, in a garden, from 6 to 9 o&rsquo;Clock, which was by far
the prettiest entertainment I ever was at.&nbsp; The Dean of
Winch&mdash;ter has a fine and large Garden, which is a place of
resort on summer evenings, for all the persons of fashion (which
are many) in the city.&nbsp; It consists of a large lawn, at the
end of which, (or rather through which) passes a quick river,
that has a Chinese bridge over it, and is formed into two
cascades, as it runs along.&nbsp; There is also a large grove,
fine walks of gravel, and two or three alcoves.&nbsp; Here the
officers desired leave to introduce the music, and give the
ladies a Ball.&nbsp; The Dean consented, and all the gentry and
quality in and about the place were put together there.&nbsp; And
for the three hours I spake of, 25 couples danced on the lawn on
one side of the river, the musicians standing on the other.&nbsp;
There were 25 hands, and all good ones.&nbsp; They have learnt at
home the tunes of our English Dances, which are practised there
in compliment to our sovereign and country.&nbsp; In the dancing
one could not but observe, how true the officers stept both to
the time and tune: whereas the dancing of the English gentlemen,
and most of the ladies too, was what one may call <i>Romps run
mad</i>.&nbsp; The day before I came away, the troops from all
the towns were encamped, about a mile and a half from the city,
which afforded me a mornings amusement of the most agreeable
sort.&nbsp; The Dean and Prebendaries, who have each of them a
good income; [and I&rsquo;ll assure you, most of &rsquo;em, live
up to it, as Peg B&mdash; said of the Week&rsquo;s Preparation]
have done these Foreigners honour at their Tables with high
gentility.&nbsp; They almost all come to the Cathedral, and one
of &rsquo;em who sat next me, by some broken English of his, and
some bad <i>latin</i>, both of his and mine, was made to
understand all the ceremonies that were performed <i>by</i> and
<i>upon</i> me in the church, on the sunday I took
possession.&nbsp; He seemed better satisfied with all other
things, than with our surplices, scarves, and scarlet hoods;
which he looked upon with somewhat of an evil eye: For, you know,
that from the days of good Q. B&mdash;ss to these days some of
the protestants abroad have objected to our Ecclesiastical
Dresses as <i>Popish</i>&mdash;and some even of our own Divines
have boggled at them in her time.&mdash;They have brought no
<i>women</i> with them, but a few of the soldiers wives, who are
very clean, large, and fleshy.&nbsp; They put on when they get
abroad a Straw Bonnet, which shades and almost hides their faces,
and a callico or printed linen cloak, very long and
full.&mdash;The persons at Winch&mdash;r of the female sex [like
those of another place that we know] are all, or would all pass
for, fine gentlewomen.&nbsp; And I could not for my life help
being diverted with a question asked by the simple <i>Hessian
Women</i> concerning them.&nbsp; <i>Pray</i>, said they, <i>have
you none but ladies of quality in this place</i>?&nbsp; The
answer was, that there was but one lady of quality [Lady
Jernegan] in the city.&nbsp; <i>Well</i>, said they, <i>we
thought they were all such</i>; for in <i>our country</i>, they
who are <i>always dress&rsquo;d out</i>, and <i>going from
home</i>, <i>are ladies of quality</i>: so we thought that ye
were all quality.&mdash;One of the superior officers quartered at
Southampton (where the resort of company to drink and bathe in
the sea water, has benefited the place and spoilt the people)
seeing all the gentlewomen of the town gadding abroad
o&rsquo;mornings, to the public rooms, or idle visits, bought up
all the <i>Thimbles</i> he could get; and one morning when
abundance of them were together in a public place, he presented
each with a Thimble, saying, it must needs be, that they wanted
the requisites to employ them properly <i>at</i> home, or they
would not be constantly <i>from</i> home.&nbsp; This pretty
reproof has produced a great deal of mirth, but very little
reformation, that I heard of, among the Southhampton
<i>Quality</i>.&mdash;The emoluments of churchmen as well as
others who live in Hampshire, [at Winch&mdash;r especially] ought
to be good.&nbsp; For (put all articles together that belong to
house-keeping) and things are dearer there, than with you, by 7
and 6 pence in the pound.&nbsp; There is very little difference
between the rate of eatables, coals. &amp;c. there and in
London.&nbsp; Fowls of all sorts, pigs, rabbets, are very high
priced, and fish is 6<i>d.</i> a mouthful, tho&rsquo; Southampton
is so near.&nbsp; For the fine folks that come down from London
have in a very few years more than doubled the rate of that sort
of food, even upon the place.&nbsp; But the worst circumstance
belonging to both that city and county, is that there are many
<i>Roman Catholicks</i>.&nbsp; One of that persuasion would have
hired my prependal house at a considerable rent, for the term of
the bishop&rsquo;s life, till the end of which I shall not fit it
up for my own use.&nbsp; I sent such an answer that I shall
ne&rsquo;er be applied to again by any body of that stamp:
&lsquo;any other person of fashion shall have it for half the
money, and be thanked into the bargain.&rsquo;&nbsp; In looking
over what I have writ, I find I have filled a sheet; this
surprizes me, for I did not intend to fill more than a
side.&nbsp; If you have as much patience as you used to have, may
be you have read it all.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t do a more
acceptable thing than to write to me, at any time, and at this
time, it will be a sort of charity, I being greatly dejected in
<i>spirit</i>, at the state of public affairs.&nbsp; Our Common
prayer says, what is entirely true, &lsquo;There is none that
fighteth for us but only God:&rsquo; and I wish I could be sure
we had him on our side.&nbsp; God bless us all.&nbsp; God bless
you and yours, and all that you and I love, and that love
us&mdash;But, as <i>Falstaff</i> says, &lsquo;a pox on all
cowards.&rsquo;&mdash;So says your most humble servant, E.
P.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the preceding we beg leave to subjoin the following letter,
or rather <i>fragment</i> of a letter.&nbsp; That it is
<i>from</i> the same hand seems sufficiently certain from both
external and internal evidence.&nbsp; It was written in 1756,
probably to his father, and it might be one of the last, if not
the very last that passed between them.&nbsp; We insert it the
more readily because so honourable to Bp. Hoadly&rsquo;s memory,
and not otherwise to that of Dr. F.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dr. <i>Thackery</i>, who keeps a school an
<i>Harrow</i> on the <i>Hill</i>, has one living and 14
children.&nbsp; A man bred at Eaton, and a great scholar in the
Eaton way, and a good one every way, a true Whig, and proud to be
so by some special marks of integrity.&nbsp; He was candidate for
the Headship of King&rsquo;s, and would have beat all men but
George, and George too, if Sir R. W. had not made George&rsquo;s
promotion a point.&nbsp; Since this disappointment he took the
school of <i>Harrow</i> to educate his own and other
people&rsquo;s children; where he has performed all along with
great reputation.&nbsp; The Bp. of W. never saw this man in his
life; but had heard so much good of him, that he resolved to
serve him some way of other, if ever he could&mdash;but said
nothing to any body.&nbsp; On friday last he sent for this Dr. T.
and when he came into the room, my lord gave him a parchment, and
told him he had long heard of his good character, and long been
afraid he should never be able to give him any serviceable proof
of the good opinion he had long conceived of him: That what he
had put into his hands was the <i>archdeaconry of Surry</i>,
which he hoped would be acceptable to him, as he might perform
the duty of it yearly, at the time of his leisure in the Easter
Holidays.&nbsp; Dr. T. was surprized and overcome with this
extraordinary manner of doing him a favour, that he was very near
fainting as he was giving him institution.&mdash;Tis 130<i>l.</i>
a year, with dependencies that may bring in a deal of
money.&mdash;1756.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="footnote1030"></a><a href="#citation1030"
class="footnote">[1030]</a>&nbsp; What led the author to this
supposition or conclusion was an anecdote said to have been
written by Dr. H. himself; in these words&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In Turner de morbis cutaneis See Wts.
related by Langius of a woman longing to bite a baker&rsquo;s
shoulder.&mdash;Somewhat like this was the case of Mrs. Forest
the wife of an alderman (or baliff as they are called in
Scotland) of <i>Haddington</i> in <i>East Lothian</i>; who having
had 4 or 5 daughters, and then with child of a boy, and lying by
her husband awake, while he was fast asleep, in a summer-morning,
his shoulder lying bare, she long&rsquo;d to taste of it, and
after a great desire could not forbear fixing her teeth.&nbsp; He
waking jump&rsquo;d out of bed thinking she was mad, but being
soon convinced of what was the matter, easily forgave the fact,
but would not venture a second trial.&nbsp; After dressing and
taking care of the slight wound, he soon after made a jest of the
news to his companions at the tavern: but while they were a
whetting, news was brought him that his wife was miscarried of a
boy; upon which he merrily said, &lsquo;d&mdash;mn it, if I had
known it was a boy her longing should have been
satisfied.&rsquo;&mdash;This I had from the woman herself upon
enquiry: for the story was notorious about the time I was born,
1669.&nbsp; G. H.&mdash;M. Dr.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="footnote1037"></a><a href="#citation1037"
class="footnote">[1037]</a>&nbsp; Those traits in his character
have been often elucidated by divers well known anecdotes, two or
three of which we will here take the liberty of
inserting.&mdash;One of them is given in a letter of Dr. Pyle, if
we are not mistaken, of the date of 1752, addressed perhaps to
his father.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Your old friend Sir W. B. came to my Lord
Bp. of Winch&mdash;r some weeks ago, and told him that he waited
upon him for a pension payable out of his estate to the College
of Physicians.&nbsp; My Lord said, he never heard of any such
pension paid out of his revenues; and as to an estate of his own,
he had none.&nbsp; Yes, says the knight, you are chargeable
herewith out of such an estate.&nbsp; My Lord said, he had no
estate any where of his own, and as Bp. of W. he had no such
estate as was named.&nbsp; Bp. of W&mdash;! quoth the knight; why
then lam wrong; you are not the person.&nbsp; I wanted Sir Cecil
Bishop, and they told me he lived here.&nbsp; Is Sir C. B. a
clergyman, says my Lord?&nbsp; No, says the knight.&nbsp; Why
then Sir you might have seen your mistake immediately, and so
your Servant.&nbsp; This dog certainly wanted to see how the Bp.
look&rsquo;d, and thence judge of his being likely to live or
not, on account of some estate that somebody he knows, is to buy
or renew, who hold of the Bp. of W. and nobody but a man of his
parts and assurance could, have got to the sight of him;&rdquo;
[<i>July</i> 1752.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another anecdote of him is related by Bp. Warburton in a
Letter to Hurd; dated Prior Park, Nov. 18th 1767.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When you see Dr. Heberden pray communicate
to him an unexpected honour I lately received.&nbsp; The other
day word was brought me from below, that one Sir William Browne
sent up his name, and would be glad to kiss my hand.&nbsp; I
judged it to be the famous physician, whom I had never seen, nor
had the honour to know.&nbsp; When I came down into the drawing
room I was accosted by a little, round, well fed gentleman, with
a large muff in one hand, and a small Horace open in the other,
and a spying-glass dangling in a black ribbon at his
button.&nbsp; After the first salutation he informed me that his
visit was indeed to me, but principally, and in the first place,
to Prior Park, which had so inviting a prospect from below: and
he had no doubt but on examination it would sufficiently pay the
trouble he had given himself of coming up to it on foot.&nbsp; We
then took our chairs; and the first thing he did or said, was to
propose a doubt to me concerning a passage in Horace, which all
this time he had still open in his hand.&nbsp; Before I could
answer he gave me the solution of this long misunderstood
passage: and in support of his explanation had the charity to
repeat his own paraphrase of it in English verse, just come hot,
as he said, from the brain.&nbsp; When this and chocolate were
over, having seen all he wanted of me, he desired to see
something more of the seat; and particularly what be called the
<i>Monument</i>, by which I understood him to mean, the
Prior&rsquo;s tower, with your inscription.&nbsp; Accordingly I
ordered a servant to attend him thither; and, when he had
satisfied his curiosity, either to let him out from the park
above into the down, or from the garden below into the
road.&nbsp; Which he chose I never asked; and so this honourable
visit ended.&nbsp; Hereby you will understand, that the design of
all this was to be <i>admired</i>.&nbsp; And indeed he had <i>my
admiration</i> to the full; but for nothing so much, as for being
able at past eighty to perform this expedition on foot, in no
good weather, and with all the alacrity of a boy, both in body
and mind.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Before we dismiss this anecdote, it ought to be observed that
the bishop was somewhat incorrect in two instances at least: 1st.
in representing our knight as a <i>little man</i>; 2<i>ndly.</i>
in saying that he was then <i>past eighty</i>.&nbsp; Those who
knew and remember him, speak of him as a <i>tall man</i>; and it
is certain that he wanted several weeks of seventy six when he
visited Prior Park.]&mdash;The next anecdote and the last that we
shall here relate, came from the late Thomas Hollingworth, many
years a respectable bookseller in this town, and who settled here
under Dr. Browne&rsquo;s patronage.&nbsp; He used to say that the
first time he had to make out his bill after the doctor had been
dubbed a knight, he wrote <i>Sir William Browne debtor to Tho.
Hollingworth</i>.&nbsp; When he delivered it into the
knight&rsquo;s hand, he looked at it a short time, and then
looking at him said, Mr. H. you might have said <i>the
honourable</i> Sir Wm. Browne.&nbsp; I beg your pardon Sir Wm.
replied the bookseller, but upon my word I did not know that it
was customary to prefix to the name of a knight the word
<i>honourable</i>.&nbsp; As to that, rejoined the knight,
tho&rsquo; it be not customary, it would yet have been
pleasing.&mdash;That to be sure was childish and ridiculous
enough; but we believe that with all his eccentricities and
foibles, Sir. Wm. B. was far from being one of the most
disreputable or unworthy characters that were to be found among
the gentlemen of this town and its vicinity during his long
residence here.</p>
<p><a name="footnote1039"></a><a href="#citation1039"
class="footnote">[1039]</a>&nbsp; The rough draught, or fragment
of a translation of the inscription is longer, but the rest the
present writer could not well make out.&mdash;The above seems
enough to give the reader a pretty just idea of the tenor of the
whole.&mdash;Before we entirely dismiss this article, or take our
final leave of Sir Wm. we should not omit to notice the much
admired impromptu, or extemporaneous epigram produced by him when
a regiment of horse happened to be quartered at <i>Oxford</i>,
and the king having purchased the noble library of Bp.
<i>Moore</i>, made a present of it to the university of
<i>Cambridge</i>.&nbsp; The epigram was an answer to one that had
been made by a Dr. Trapp, a witty, torified clergyman, on that
occasion, in these words,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The king, observing with judicious eyes<br
/>
The wants of his two universities;<br />
To <i>Oxford</i> sent a <i>troop of horse</i>, for why?<br />
That <i>learned</i> body wanted <i>loyalty</i>:<br />
To Cambridge he sent <i>books</i>, as well discerning,<br />
That that right <i>loyal</i> body wanted
<i>learning</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which drew from Sir Wm. the following reply, said so have been
much commended, even by Dr. Johnson.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Contrary methods justly George applies,<br
/>
To govern his two universities;<br />
To <i>Oxford</i> is dispatched a troop of horse,<br />
Since <i>Tories</i> own no argument like <i>force</i>;<br />
To <i>Cambridge</i> Ely&rsquo;s learned books are sent,<br />
Since <i>Whigs</i> admit no force like
<i>argument</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="footnote1052"></a><a href="#citation1052"
class="footnote">[1052]</a>&nbsp; The loose livers, (or whores
and rogues of the parish, as some would call them) used to bring
their <i>bastard</i> children to him to <i>christen</i>, or make
them christians, although they discovered no desire or
inclination to live soberly, righteously, and godly, or become
christians themselves.&nbsp; This he thought very improper and
objectionable, and no less than a direct profanation of a
religious rite; and therefore refused to christen such children,
unless their parents made a profession of repentance, and
solemnly promised to forsake those irregular and vicious courses,
and lead for the future virtuous and pious lives.&nbsp; Some
willingly complied with his requirement, upon whose children
therefore he performed the said rite.&nbsp; Others could not be
prevailed upon to submit to this requirement, for which reason he
left their children unchristened, which gave great umbrage, not
only to their parents and such like folk, but even to his own
ecclesiastical superiors, up to the very bishop&mdash;all blamed
him for having any scruples about such frivolous, harmless, and
indifferent matters as these.&nbsp; Some also even of the most
decent among his parishioners disapproved of his refusing to
christen the said bastard children, it being, as they said,
punishing the poor things for the sins of their parents.&nbsp;
Forbidding those of loose or immoral lives to come to the
Lord&rsquo;s Table was another circumstance that gave great
offence, and caused him no small trouble.&nbsp; One of these was
the greatest man in the parish, or head Squire of the place; and
a very fierce and dashing fellow he certainly was.&nbsp; He, by
way of retaliation and revenge, set himself about picking holes
in Mr. R&rsquo;s coat.&nbsp; They were not indeed of an immoral,
but rather an uncanonical nature.&nbsp; Mr. R. had allowed a
certain worthy person to partake of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper
<i>sitting</i> instead of <i>kneeling</i>.&nbsp; He also had
<i>not</i> made a point of wearing the <i>surplice</i> while
performing the burial service and some other duties.&nbsp; He had
likewise taken the liberty of using the word <i>honour</i>
instead of <i>worship</i> in the marriage service, and moreover
of curtailing occasionally the liturgic part of the public
service.&nbsp; These deviations were magnified into serious
misdoings, and looked upon by his superiors in a very
unfavourable light.&nbsp; Wherefore his conduct was afterwards
more closely scrutinized; and from the examination and confession
of his church-wardens the following articles of accusation were
extracted, upon which he was proceeded against in the
ecclesiastical court&mdash;1. That he did not read the Litany on
<i>Wednesdays and Fridays</i>: 2. That he did not constantly wear
the surplice in all his administrations: 3. That he did not
usually administer the communion on <i>Christmas-day</i>, unless
it fell on <i>Sunday</i>.&nbsp; Nor on <i>Whit-Sunday</i>.&nbsp;
4. That he did not read over the <i>Canons</i> and
<i>Articles</i> twice a year.&nbsp; 5. That there were two
children unbaptiz&rsquo;d in the parish, which he refused to
baptize.&nbsp; 6. That he was in the habit of conversing (or was
on friendly terms) with one Mr. Richardson, an excommunicate
person.&mdash;[Now this person was a worthy, pious dissenting
minister, who had been persecuted for conscience sake, or for
nonconformity, and excommunicated: and it was expected that no
clergyman would converse or associate with him, unless he
recanted: which was a sort of morality or religion which Rastrick
did not approve, and therefore did not choose to practise.]&nbsp;
The first time he appeared before the spiritual Court at Lincoln
to answer to the above articles or charges, he had nothing to do
but only to retain a <i>Proctor</i> against the next
court-day.&nbsp; When that time came, it fell out to be the very
day when king James&rsquo;s Declaration for liberty of conscience
came first down into the country, which must have been in the
spring of 1687.&nbsp; At this his second appearance he found the
court very much down in the mouth (as he expresses it) and far
from the heat and violence in their proceedings that he
expected.&nbsp; They did however proceed to business, and went
over each of those charges, but came to no determination: not
thinking perhaps the then aspect of things favourable enough to
warrant a rigorous decision.&nbsp; However that was, Rastrick was
now becoming more and more dissatisfied with the terms of
conformity, and began soon to think of availing himself of the
royal Declaration of liberty of conscience to quit his public
station in the church, as he actually did before the close of
that same year.&nbsp; After which he seems to have continued
disengaged till 1701, when he settled with the Presbyterian
congregation in this town.</p>

here within the present year (1811,) only with this difference,

class="footnote">[1059]</a>&nbsp; As a manuscript it is very
curious for the neatness and smartness of the writing, especially
as it appears to be written when the author was above 70 years of
age.&nbsp; The beginning of the Preface, where matter
corroborative of what was above suggested occurs, reads
thus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Perceiving that Antinomianism is in a great
part grown to be the completion of the dissenting interest in
England, as far as my observation reaches, to the great reproach
of the reformation, and scandal of the opposers of its progress:
and that many who pretend to be against it are yet fond of the
doctrines and opinions on which it is founded; grounding all
their divinity on the decrees of God alone, abstracted from his
rule of government; falling in with the hypothesis of necessity
and fate, on which Hobbes founded his Atheism: making all
God&rsquo;s government to be merely physical, to the destruction
of all religion and morality: not enduring to hear of a
justification by works in any sense, though it be undeniably a
scripture doctrine and expression, <i>Jam.</i> 2.
24:&mdash;asserting such an imputation of Christ&rsquo;s
righteousness as is essentially and formally altogether
unscriptural; and the like: by which means sinners are hardened
in their sin, comforted against necessary fears conducive to
their safety; charity, alms-deeds, and all good works at a fatal
stop; people taught to presume without ground; calling a good
conscience, or a consciousness of keeping Christ&rsquo;s
commandments, the building on a rotten foundation: tho&rsquo;
Christ saith the contrary.&nbsp; <i>Math.</i> 7, 24.&nbsp;
Learned, able, and faithful ministers rejected and discouraged,
and illiterate persons that will indulge men in their
soporiferous notions set up in their room&mdash;I say, perceiving
and musing on these things, and <i>exercised</i> by a party of
weak christians under the aforesaid impressions; understanding
the state of christian doctrine amongst us, and the divided
condition of the Churches about it, and casting my eyes upon that
text in <i>John</i> 15, 10. as one of the plainest and fullest
decisive of these controversies: so many thoughts sprung up in my
mind upon it, that to preserve them.&nbsp; I immediately set pen
to paper and wrote down above twenty of the following
propositions before I took it off; to which the rest were quickly
added.&nbsp; By which time I purposed to preach from that text,
and lay them all before <i>my own congregation who so much needed
it</i>: which I did with different success; viz. the usual
distaste of the <i>discontented party</i>, but so much to the
satisfaction and acceptance of others, my worthy friends, that I
was greatly and constantly importun&rsquo;d to present them to
their eyes, as I had done before to their ears.&nbsp; And having
been called to preach at a meeting of ministers at
<i>Nottingham</i> on the 26th of June 1718, I made no particular
preparation for it, but took a text out of the 22 chap. of
<i>Math.</i> part of the parable of the marriage feast, the whole
of which I had preached over at home, but now only so much of it
as would afford me matter suitable to the whole congregation,
both ministers and people.&nbsp; And being by my brethren desired
to publish my Sermon, I was forced to deny them their request at
that time, because what I had delivered was pick&rsquo;d out of a
great many discourses, and what I thought most proper for the
auditory at that time only, but would have been a maining to the
whole.&nbsp; Yet I did not despise their motion, nor lay aside
all consideration of it.&nbsp; The importunity of some of them
ran so much in my mind, that . . .&nbsp; I thought if I must
write I might digest the matter of that sermon into the following
Treatise, without deviating from the design of it, but rather
conveniently adding to the principles of it, which I have done,
hoping that they will accept it here, with the rest, by which the
doctrines of that sermon are better stated, cleared, and
confirmed, than they would have appeared to have been if that
sermon had gone alone.&nbsp; So in this way I shall answer the
desires of my friends at home and my reverend brethren abroad at
once; and do what service I can to the Church of God before I
die.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole preface is very long, this being but a small part of
it.&nbsp; But this is enough to shew that there was in this
congregation a party that disapproved of his ministry, as well as
another that highly approved of it, and that he experienced a
great deal of discomfort from the former, who appear to have been
very calvinistically or antinomianly inclined, and withal very
contentious, as their descendants or successors have been almost
ever since.</p>
<p><a name="footnote1060"></a><a href="#citation1060"
class="footnote">[1060]</a>&nbsp; Some of those thoughts relate
to the <i>Theory of Comets</i>, which he supposed to be worlds in
a state of conflagration and dissolution; and he thought it
probable our Earth will hereafter become a comet and be seen as
such in remote regions of the universe.&nbsp; This comet state of
a Heavenly body he considered as a state of judgment, and
indicating the previous apostacy and irreclaimable impenitence or
rebellion of its rational inhabitants, which caused the very
world they inhabited to be so devoted to destruction.&nbsp; Each
of those devoted worlds, he thought, had its <i>saviour</i> and
offers of mercy sent to it long previous to that awful and fatal
catastrophe.&nbsp; Christ he believed to be the saviour only of
this world, from which he draws some curious inferences
favourable to his own system.&mdash;According to his notion the
same comet could not be expected to appear twice in our system:
nor would that, perhaps, even in this day, be very easily
refuted.</p>

He nature at one glance surveys,<br />

To some age or some world unknown,<br />
Swifter than time and impatient of stay,<br />
To the west, to the uttermost limits of day,<br />
To the end of the world I&rsquo;ll hasten away:<br />

The mines to hot volcanos turn;<br />
Their horrid jaws extended wide,<br />
The sulphurous contagion spread.</p>
<p>Why do the aged mountains skip,<br />
And little hills like their own sheep,<br />
Like lambs, which on their grizzly head<br />
Once wanton play&rsquo;d?<br />
Expanded vapours, struggling to the birth,<br />
Roar in the bowels of the earth.</p>
<p>And now the Earth&rsquo;s foundations crack assunder,<br />

Fiery torrents rolling down,<br />
The naked valleys drown;<br />

The channels of th&rsquo;exhausted sea.</p>
<p>Seas, to thin vapours boil&rsquo;d away,<br />
Leave their crooked channels dry:<br />
And not one drop returns again,<br />
To cool the thirsty Earth with rain.</p>
<p>And must all Earth th&rsquo;impartial ruin share?<br />
Spare ye revengeful angels, spare!<br />
Spare the Muses blissful seat:<br />
Let me for <i>Wickham&rsquo;s</i> peaceful walls intreat.<br />
No, &rsquo;tis in vain: and <i>Bodley&rsquo;s</i> spicy nest<br

Of learning too must perish with the rest;<br />
&mdash;The <i>Oracles of God</i> alone<br />
An hasty Angel snatch&rsquo;d away,<br />
And bore them high through parted flames<br />
To the Eternal throne.</p>
<p>Behold! fond soul, all thou didst once admire,<br />
The objects of thy hope and thy desire;<br />
Houses and lands and large estate;<br />
The little things that make men great:<br />
The empty trifles are no more,<br />
But vanish all in smoke, scarce lighter than before.</p>
<p>Was it for this the Statesman wrackt his thought?<br />
Was it for this the Soldier fought?<br />
While grumbling drums like thunder beat,<br />
And clanging trumpets rais&rsquo;d the martial heat?</p>

following extract of a Letter from her to her son, the
ambassador, in 1745, when this town assumed such a warlike
appearance; as was observed at p. 920.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This place, heretofore famous for the arts
and blessings of peace, is now entirely in the guise of
war.&nbsp; Every thing has a military air.&nbsp; The ditch before
the walls is scoured; but there are unhappily so many hay-stacks
just by, that a few Highlanders, or French, by casting two or
three of them into the deepest part of it, might be masters of
the town in about four hours.&nbsp; The bridge of St. Germans and
those above it are to be cut down, if we hear any of the rebels
have escaped through the Fens, and are coming towards us.&nbsp;
But the river is fordable in many places, and several of them are
near the town.&nbsp; The body of the people are formed into 5
regiments, which are commanded by proper officers, chosen out of
the body politic.&nbsp; Those whose spouses bear rule over them
being disposed into one regiment called greys.&nbsp; Those heroes
spend their mornings and evenings in the Guildhall, there
learning the trade of war, under able and experienced
masters.&nbsp; No merchant sells deals, salt, pitch or tar,
without a weapon by their side.&nbsp; Shopkeepers have taken to
the sword, and divide their cags of soap with their blades.&nbsp;
You can&rsquo;t purchase a joint of meat, or a loaf of bread, or
a pound of candles but of an armed man.&nbsp; Even clergymen are
engaged in these death-doing measures.&nbsp; One bears a
captain&rsquo;s commission.&nbsp; Another is a sutler.&nbsp; Most
of the fair and timerous persons of the other sex, who had any
wits a while ago, have very few remaining now.&nbsp; An ancient

line of his profession, not only as a practitioner, but likewise
as a writer; though he was not rewarded according to his
merit.&nbsp; Many of his works, at his death, were left in
manuscript, most of which still remain in that state; but some
have been since published, in addition to those that appeared in
his life time.&nbsp; Of his published works the following are
thought the most remarkable&mdash;1. &ldquo;A paper on a
<i>puncture in the bladder</i>,&rdquo; inserted in the Phil.
Trans. vol. 66.&mdash;2. &ldquo;A paper on the disease called

&ldquo;Letters on the cause and treatment of the <i>Gout</i>, in
which some digressive remarks on other medical subjects are
interspersed;&rdquo; published by Whittingham, Lynn, and Sold by
Crosby, London, 1806.&nbsp; Before we close this brief memoir of
Dr. Hamilton we may just observe that he, as was before said of
Mr. Rastrick and another person, sometimes left his profounder
studies and amused himself in writing verses, of which a specimen
may be seen at the beginning of his &ldquo;Observations on the
Marsh Remittent Fever.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the same work, at page 89,
we also learn how long it was that Dr. Hepburn practised physic
in this town, and consequently at what time he settled here,
which appears to have been about the spring or early part of the
year 1694, whence was about 25 years of age.&nbsp; This had
escaped the author&rsquo;s observation till after the memoir of
Dr. Hepburn had been printed off, otherwise he would not have
represented the doctor&rsquo;s settlement here as taking place at
or <i>about the commencement the last century</i>, which is six
years at least later than the time when it did take place.&nbsp;
This is mentioned here for the purpose of correcting that
mistatement, and enabling the reader to fix the true date of Dr.
Hepburn&rsquo;s first settlement here.&mdash;The passage referred
to in Dr. Hamilton&rsquo;s book reads thus,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The late Dr. George Hepburn, who practised
physic at Lynn upwards of 65 years, <a name="citation1082"></a><a
href="#footnote1082" class="citation">[1082]</a> and whose
medical ability, sagacity, and judgment, were equalled by few,
and surpassed by none of his contemporaries, told me that he was
so folly convinced of the great efficacy, as well as perfect
innocence and safety of large doses of the Peruvian bark, that
being attacked by an intermittent fever himself at an early
period of his medical career in this town, and at a time when he
had, in an epidemic season, a great deal of practice in the
country, took at one dose an ounce of the Peruvian bark in
powder, mounted his horse immediately after it, went to visit his
patients, and had no more of his disease.&rdquo;</p>

excited in Olybius, preside of the east, under the Romans, a
desire to marry her; but finding she was a christian, deferred it
till he could persuade her to renounce her religion.&nbsp; Not
being able to accomplish that object, he first put her to extreme
tortures, and then beheaded her.&nbsp; She has the same office

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This church (says <i>Mackerell</i>)
deserves to be taken particular notice of, as it is of no mean
extent, being a very large, stately, and magnificient pile,
built, as most cathedrals in England are, in the perfect form of
a cross, and contains in <i>length</i> within the walls, by
mensuration 240 feet; in <i>breadth</i>, including the cross, 118
feet, and in <i>height</i> from the highest battlements 52
feet.&nbsp; About the middle or cross isle it is graced with a
very fair and lofty <i>Lanthorn</i>, all covered with lead,
mounted on four main arches within the body of the church, in
which hangs the <i>Clock-Bell</i>, which may be heard all over
the town.&nbsp; The height of this ornamental fabrick is 132
feet.&nbsp; It was neatly painted within with several coats of
arms and other decorations in 1621.&mdash;At the west end is a
tower of stone 82 feet high; on the outside of which towards the
street, is placed a Moon-Dial, shewing the increase and decrease
of that planet, with the exact hour of the day to all that pass
by, actuated within by clock work, and new beautified and gilt in
1710.&nbsp; On this tower is a very high and regular spire, of
timber, all covered with lead, resembling a pyramid, in height
193 feet; [but] in all, from the superficies of the ground, it is
275 feet, including the spindle of iron with a cross on the top,
and under it a vane in form of a hand, both gilt, which was new
set up in 1630; the former one having continued full 70 years,
being erected in 1568. [rather 1558.]&nbsp; The model of the
spire is surprizing.&nbsp; Near this [and parallel with it on the
north side] is the Bell-Tower, built of freestone 86 feet high,
in which formerly were <i>five</i> very large bells, of which the
biggest was called <i>the Margaret</i>, and was for her curious
sound one of the fairest of that kind, and might be heard (the
wind favouring, as I have been assured) full ten miles
distant.&nbsp; Others had likewise their distinct names, as
<i>the Trinity</i>, <i>the St. Thomas</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>&nbsp;
So christened, I suppose, as was usual before the
reformation.&nbsp; But the <i>biggest</i> and the <i>least</i> of
these were purposely broken, and with some addition cast into
others, to make a ring of <i>eight</i>, which was effected in
1663.&mdash;This noble structure is illuminated with above 70
arched windows, and others, all formerly of painted glass,
representing the pictures of saints in sacred scripture, with
other holy men and women, martyrs and confessors; of which that
high and lofty one on the south side and cross isle is [was] very
remarkable, [exhibiting] as I am informed, the whole history of
<i>St. Margaret</i>, the patroness of this church; and that
circular one over the altar [containing] the genealogy of the
kings of Israel, is now to be seen almost all entire, where also
underneath the same are depicted the Town-Arms, and on the south
windows in the Quire are still remaining several coats of arms in
lively colours, and very fair.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[In the time of the civil wars most of the painted glass in
those windows was, it seems, taken down and replaced with white
glass, the former being looked upon, by those who were then in
power here, as savouring too much of <i>popery</i> and
superstition.&nbsp; See <i>Mackerell</i>, p. 8, &amp;c.&mdash;Of
its present state Mr. <i>Britton</i> writes as follows.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The <i>church</i> was a large spacious
structure, and though curtailed of its original dimensions, is
still a noble pile.&nbsp; Internally it displays a nave, with
ailes, which constitute the present place for service; a chancel
or choir, with ailes; a transept and two towers at the west
end.&nbsp; The roof is supported by 22 columns; of which those
east of the transept are formed by a cluster of five shafts
each.&nbsp; In this part of the building are some ancient carved
stalls, and several flat monumental stones, with inscriptions;
also some very large and fine brasses.&nbsp; At the east end is a
circular window, with ten transverse mullions.&nbsp; This part of
the church is divided from the transept by a wooden screen, which
was erected in 1622.&nbsp; A lofty tower, or <i>lanthorn</i>, is
said to have been originally at the intersection of the cross
ailes; and a high <i>spire</i> to have surmounted one of the
western towers.&nbsp; The latter display different styles of
architecture, and the lower parts of them are very ancient.&nbsp;
The buttresses of the angles to the southern tower consist of
several small shafts of columns.&nbsp; The church formerly
contained numerous brasses <a name="citation1091a"></a><a
href="#footnote1091a" class="citation">[1091a]</a> and
inscriptions, some of which remain.&rdquo; <a
name="citation1091b"></a><a href="#footnote1091b"
class="citation">[1091b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This account, we presume, is pretty fair and correct as far as
it goes, and our limits will not well allow us here to attempt
any further enlargement.&nbsp; We will, however, just add, that
the interior of this church is, for so large a building, kept in
a style of uncommon cleanliness and neatness.</p>

flourished, the date of his canonisation, and the great regard
then paid to the memory of new saints, (compared with the date of
the original erection of this chapel,) it appears more than
probable that the personage in question was St. Nicholas called
<i>Peregrinus</i>, who became famous in Apulia, and of whom
<i>Jortin</i> says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He was a Greek, born in Attica.&nbsp; His
parents were poor, and he had not learnt to read, or been bred to
any trade.&nbsp; When he was eight years of age, his mother sent
him out to take care of the sheep.&nbsp; From that time he began
to sing aloud, <i>Kyrie eleison</i>, which he did night and day;
and this act of devotion he performed all his life long.&nbsp;
His mother not being able to make him leave it off, thought that
he was possessed of the devil, and carried him to a neighbouring
monastery, where the monks shut him up and chastised him, but
could not hinder him from singing his song.&nbsp; He suffered
punishment patiently, and immediately began again.&nbsp;
Returning to his mother, he took a hatchet and a knife, and
clambering up a mountain, he cut branches of cedar, and made
crosses of them, which he stuck up in the highways, and in places
inaccessible, praising God continually.&nbsp; Upon this mountain
he built himself a little hut, and dwelt there sometime all
alone, working perpetually.&nbsp; Then he went to Lepanto, where
a monk joined himself to him and never forsook him.&nbsp; They
passed into Italy, where Nicholas was taken sometimes for an holy
man, and sometimes for a madman.&nbsp; He fasted every day until
evening; his food was a little bread and water, and yet he did
not grow lean.&nbsp; The nights he usually passed in prayer,
standing upright.&nbsp; He wore only a short vest, reaching to
his knees, his head, legs and feet being naked.&nbsp; In his hand
he carried a light wooden cross, and a scrip at his side, to
receive the alms that were given him, which he usually laid out
in fruit, to distribute to the boys who went about with him,
singing along with him <i>Kyrie eleison</i>.&nbsp; His oddities
caused him to be ill used sometimes, even by the orders of the
bishops.&nbsp; He performed, [as was said] various miracles, and
exhorted the people to repentance.&nbsp; At last falling sick,
and being visited by multitudes who came to beg his blessing, he
died, and was buried in a Cathedral, with great solemnity: and
according to custom (our author adds) a great number of miracles
was wrought at his tomb.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is related under 1094, which we take to be the year of
his death, or canonization.&nbsp; See <i>Jortin</i> Rem. Eccl.
Hist. 5. 66.&nbsp; Such was our St. Nicholas: a more harmless and
far better saint, without doubt, than <i>Dominic</i> and many
others that might be mentioned; so that his memory,
<i>comparatively speaking</i>, ought to be held in very high
estimation.</p>

which are still extant.&nbsp; A few specimens here may not be

well be supposed that they would have any great objection to our

time in such a frivolous manners, as it would leave them at
liberty to pursue their course with less observance or
interruption.&nbsp; After all, had our society of

with one of the women, (both of whom had a fireplace in their
rooms,) most unfeelingly dissuaded him from it, and he gave it
up.&mdash;The present occupier of one of those rooms is said to

is inserted the allowing note, seemingly in the same
hand&mdash;&ldquo;The above 10<i>l.</i> annuity is applied to the
clothing of the poor yearly, and payd by the chamberlain, to the

added,&mdash;&ldquo;I take this to be the 10<i>l.</i> payd to the
Treasurer of St. James&rsquo;s Workhouse, by the name of

same.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this modern note-writer, and conjectural
commentator, ought to have known that St. James&rsquo;s Workhouse
could not be called an <i>Almshouse</i> or <i>Hospital</i> in
1594, nor till near a whole century after.&nbsp; The said annuity
must therefore have undergone some foul play.</p>
<p><a name="footnote1132a"></a><a href="#citation1132a"
class="footnote">[1132a]</a>&nbsp; There are happily still some
such contributors, and among them one conspicuous above the rest,
to whose unostentatious charities the poor pensioners in all our
almshouses are not a little indebted for their comforts; as this
writer could easily perceive by what dropt from divers of them,
in the course of conversations he has had with them at different
times.&nbsp; It is here neither needful nor proper to mention the
name.&mdash;Of the <i>land</i> charged with the 10<i>l.</i> a
year to this almshouse, the following memorandum occurs in the
said MS. volume; written seemingly about 1729:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I find 76 acres on the S. marsh; viz.
Godfrey Hill, 5 acres; 7<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>&mdash;Tho. Miles, 5
acres; 7<i>l.</i> 0<i>s.</i>&mdash;Jer. Ink. J. King, and J. Lay,
14 acres; 16<i>l.</i>&mdash;Widow Carleton, 16 acres; 18<i>l.</i>
2<i>s.</i>&mdash;R. Richmund, 36 acres; 39<i>l.</i>&mdash;Total
76 acres: 88<i>l.</i>&mdash;This I take to be the land to
maintain this almhouse.&rdquo;&mdash;A little after we find the
following memorandum,&mdash;&ldquo;Payd the Hoipital 1729,
19<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> per week, for 52 weeks; 51<i>l.</i>
2<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>&mdash;Mr. Quartereder,
5<i>s.</i>&mdash;Straw money, 6<i>s.</i>&mdash;9 Chald. coles,

is the fixt yearly pay, 62<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>
besides other incident charges, repairs, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the whole therefore it appears, that the poor occupiers, or
pensioners of this almshouse were much better off 80 or a 100
years ago, than they have been for many years past, as well as
that our rulers were than better disposed towards them than they
have been latterly.</p>
<p><a name="footnote1132b"></a><a href="#citation1132b"
class="footnote">[1132b]</a>&nbsp; Since that period, the
<i>weekly</i> allowance of these pensioners appears to have
differed at different times&mdash;down to 1772 it was 19<i>s.</i>
3<i>d.</i> in all, or about 18<i>d.</i> each: From 1772 to 1791,
1<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> or about 2<i>s.</i> each: From
1791 to 1803, 1<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> or about
2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> each: From 1803 to 1811, 1<i>l.</i>
12<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> or 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> &frac34;
each.&mdash;But here it ought to be observed, that the
<i>Reader</i> has had always allowed him 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a
week more than the women.&nbsp; He has also a Chalder of Coals
allowed him, as has likewise each of the women who have
fire-places in their chambers.&nbsp; <i>Nine</i> chalders a year
are allowed this house in all;&mdash;the rest are appropriated to
the kitchen or common fireplace.</p>
<p><a name="footnote1135"></a><a href="#citation1135"
class="footnote">[1135]</a>&nbsp; Of two of these we learn, that
the <i>first</i> was established on the 1<i>st.</i> of June 1795
for a <i>hundred</i> members, who receive relief in sickness,
lying-in, old age, and upon the death of their husbands.&nbsp;
The fund is supported by a small monthly payment of their own,
and annual subscriptions from <i>honorary</i> members.&mdash;The
<i>second</i> beneficial society for the same number of poor
women, (100;) was established July 1, 1799, affording the same
allowances to them, except the pension in <i>old age</i>, which
it was found by experience could not be supported without the
assistance of many honorary members.&nbsp; It was hoped that this
society would be able to support itself; in which case the
advantages resulting from it might have been extended to any
number of poor women who might choose to embrace them.&nbsp; But
either the allowance must be still further reduced, or the
monthly payment increased, before it will be released from the
necessity of requiring at least occasional benefactions.&mdash;It
is to be hoped therefore that it will not fail of obtaining every
necessary aid and support.</p>
<p><a name="footnote1136"></a><a href="#citation1136"
class="footnote">[1136]</a>&nbsp; Of the number of these
societies, and their respective meeting places, the following
account is supposed to be pretty correct&mdash;<i>Two</i> at the
<i>Crown Tavern</i>; <i>one</i> at the <i>Three Tuns</i>;
<i>one</i> at the <i>Three Pigeons</i>; <i>two</i> at the
<i>Valiant Sailor</i>; <i>one</i> at the <i>Coach and Horses</i>;

all 23.&nbsp; There may be more, but we have not been yet able to
find them out.&mdash;As to the number of <i>Inns</i> and
<i>Public Houses</i> now in the town, they are said to be near
70, but they were formerly much more numerous: even as many as 87
some years ago.&nbsp; This decrease is not to be ascribed to a
decrease of our population, but rather to a decreasing propensity
in the inhabitants to frequent those houses, owing probably, in
part at least, to the great increase of <i>conventicles</i>, and
the increasing frequency of <i>evening services</i> in those
places, where a large proportion of the inhabitants find
themselves entertained much more innocently, profitably, and
agreeably, than at the public house:&mdash;all which however
cannot be supposed very pleasing to our publicans and
common-brewers.</p>

wants and sorrows may appear to require.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how the <i>exception</i>, in regard to <i>Methodists</i>,
could <i>exclude all suspicion of sectarian partiality</i>, we
cannot clearly understand.</p>
<p><a name="footnote1140"></a><a href="#citation1140"
class="footnote">[1140]</a>&nbsp; This appears from the following
passage in an old MS. extracted from the Hall Books&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;1580.&nbsp; Sept. 26.&nbsp; Mr. Iverye
recd. 4<i>l.</i> to buy books necessarye to be in the school for
his scholars.&nbsp; This day he accounted for the bookes, and
also repaid ye sd. moneye: 5<i>l.</i> allowed him for reparations
and other necessarie charges by him bestowed about his
house.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Decr. 15. 1587, it was agreed in the Hall to provide an
<i>usher</i>, with a salary of 8<i>l.</i> a year.&nbsp; The first
usher was <i>John Gybson</i>, clerk, but after a few months he
had 5<i>l.</i> <i>given him</i>, <i>for the town to be discharged
of him and family</i>.&nbsp; His successor was <i>Rich.
Emott</i>, B.A. whose salary was advanced to 10<i>l.</i> a
year.&nbsp; He was succeeded in the spring of 1593, (or rather
1594) by <i>John Man</i>, B.A. of Bennet Col. Cambridge, with the
same salary.&nbsp; It does not appear who, if any, immediately
succeeded him; but 18 Decr. 1612, the Hall agreed to choose an
<i>usher</i>, whose salary, (he boarding himself,) should be
16<i>l.</i> a year.&nbsp; The person chosen was probably Edwd.
Labourne, who held that situation in 1617, and had 5 marks gives
him towards his commencing M.A.&mdash;He appeared to be much
approved and held his place in 1626, and perhaps much
later.&nbsp; Of his successors we have no regular account.</p>
<p><a name="footnote1142a"></a><a href="#citation1142a"
class="footnote">[1142a]</a>&nbsp; Our school, in Knox&rsquo;s
time was rendered very remarkable by having <i>Eugene Aram</i>
for its usher; a man of uncommon acquirements and learning, but
still more distinguished by his unhappy and miserable exit, and
the horrid flagitiousness of at least one part of his life.&nbsp;
He was apprehended here in 1759, under a charge of <i>murder</i>,
committed in Yorkshire, 14 years before, and tried and convicted
at York the ensuing assizes, and soon after executed.&nbsp; His
defence at his trial was plausible and masterly; but it could
avail against the preponderating evidence of his guilt.&nbsp; The
extent of the learning in which he had made eminent proficiency
was wonderful, considering the disadvantages under which he
acquired it; and he died a melancholy proof that a very learned
man may yet be desperately wicked, and commit the most heinous
crimes.</p>
<p><a name="footnote1142b"></a><a href="#citation1142b"
class="footnote">[1142b]</a>&nbsp; It is remarkable that this
seminary, founded about 232 years ago, has had but <i>three
masters</i> for the greatest part of that time&mdash;viz. <i>Edw.
Bell</i>, <i>John Horne</i>, and <i>David Lloyd</i>: who presided
here in the whole 125 years&mdash;and all the rest but 107.</p>
<p><a name="footnote1146a"></a><a href="#citation1146a"
class="footnote">[1146a]</a>&nbsp; It ought to have been for a
much larger number.</p>
<p><a name="footnote1146b"></a><a href="#citation1146b"
class="footnote">[1146b]</a>&nbsp; The amount of the expenditure
for the last year was 73<i>l.</i> 19<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> &frac12;
which seems a large sum for a mere Sunday school.&nbsp; Half the
sum, it is presumed, would go much further, and do far more good,
if the Lancasterian plan were adopted.&mdash;Some such measure is
understood to be now in the contemplation of some of our good
townsmen.</p>
<p><a name="footnote1147"></a><a href="#citation1147"
class="footnote">[1147]</a>&nbsp; <i>Mr. Keed</i>, senior, and
Mr. <i>S. Newham</i>, were two of the most active promoters of
this institution, and the late <i>Dr. Bagge</i>, much to his
credit, was one of its very zealous patrons, and used to
subscribe for the support of it <i>Five Guineas</i> a year.</p>
<p><a name="footnote1150"></a><a href="#citation1150"
class="footnote">[1150]</a>&nbsp; At some former periods, and
especially before the reformation, our corporation members or
officers appear to have been more numerous than at present, and
some of them differently denominated.&nbsp; Hence in some records
of the time of Henry V. we read of <i>aldermen of the Gilds</i>,
twenty four <i>Jurats</i>, twenty seven
<i>Common-council-men</i>, <span class="GutSmall">TWELVE</span>
<i>burgesses</i> annually elected, whose business it was to
choose the new mayor, and nominate divers other officers,
including even the <i>town-clerk</i> and
<i>chamberlain</i>.&nbsp; These twelve were chosen as follows:
The Alderman of the gild of merchants chose <i>four</i>
burgesses: those four chose <i>eight</i> more, making their whole
number then <i>twelve</i>.&mdash;These twelve chose the mayor,
&amp;c. for the ensuing year, after taking an oath which was
tendered to them thus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Serres [i.e. Sirs,] ye shall well and
truiye, upon your discressions, without affection, favour,
fraude, or male engyn, chese our mayster the Mayre for the yeear
coming from Mighelmass forth, a burgess of the 24, abyll,
sufficient, and profitable, for the worship and profitt of the
commons; and also ye shall chese 4 sufficient burgesses to
occupye the office of Chamberlein for the same yeear, a comon
Clerke and two Sergeants, thereof one shall be clerke of the
Markett and keeper of the East Yates, a porter for the South
Yates, and anoder for Doucehille&rsquo;s Yates: which officers
chosen, theyr names with my mayster the Mayre that shall be, ye
shall present; so God ye help at the holy dome.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The oath tendered to the said <i>four</i> burgesses was worded
thus.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Serres&mdash;ye shall well and trulye, upon
your discressions, chese and call to you <i>eight</i> abyll
burgeys, without any affection, fraude, or male engyne, of the
most indifferent, and not suspect persones, for the election of
my mayster the Mayre that is to come; so God you help at the holy
dome.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The oath tendered to the Gild <i>alderman</i> (or rather, as
it would seem, <i>aldermen</i>) empowered to choose the above
four burgesses, was thus expressed&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Serres;&mdash;ye shall well and trulye upon
your discressions, without any affection, favour, fraude, or
male-engine, chese and call up <i>four</i> burges, abyll, of the
most indifferent, and not suspect persons, for the election of my
mayster the Mayre: so God you help at the holy dome.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The oath tendered to each of the 24 <i>Jurats</i> was as
follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Serre;&mdash;ye shall be ready and buxom to
my mayster the Mayre at all tymes when ye be called by him, or
warned by the Sergeante, for the nedes and worship of this towne
and the commonaltie thereof, and well and trulye councill him,
for the proffitte and worshipe of this towne after your
discression, and the counsell of this towne trulye kepe; so God
you help at the holy dome.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to the 27 Common-councilmen, their oath ran in much the
same strain, only referring to their particular designation, as
overseers or superintendents of all <i>taxes</i>,
<i>tallages</i>, <i>dymes</i>, <i>fiftenes</i>, <i>loones</i>,
<i>reparacions</i>, <i>amending of houses</i>, <i>walles</i>,
<i>brigges</i>, <i>fletes</i>, and <i>dyches</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>
<p>That tendered to the <i>Sergeant</i> began thus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ser; ye shall swere that ye shall be redy
and buxom to my mayster the Mayre at all tymes, and truelye warne
the 24 and 27 to come to the gild halle, or into any other
place.&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That tendered to the <i>Keeper of the East Gate</i> was
expressed thus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ser; ye shall well, duelye, and truelye
kepe the East Yates, and the Gannock Yate, and lete out and in
the pepyll in dewe tyme, and lete the Couses shake in dewe tyme,
to scoure the fletes of this towne, and oversee the markett, that
the vitalls that come to the towne by land or by water be not
ferestalled, nor hydde in no prive place, and every day be
attendant on your mayster the Mayre, and all other things truelye
to do and use that belongeth or perteyneth to the office of the
portership, and keper of the markett; so God you help at holy
dome.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The oath tendered to the <i>keeper of the South Gate</i> was
in this form.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ser, ye shall well and trewlye kepe the
South Yates, and lete the pepyll in and oute in lawful tyme, and
buxom be to my mayster the Mayre, and to his commandments, for
the proffitte and worshipe of this towne; so God you help at holy
dome.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The oaths tendered to the rest of our officers and
functionaries of those times are in a similar strain, and they
are very curious, but are too long to be all inserted here.&nbsp;
All the other officers being sworn by the <i>town-clerk</i>, the
oaths are so expressed as to denote that circumstance; but the
case in respect to <i>his own oath</i> being different, it is
varied in its form accordingly, and thus worded&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ser, I shall be obedient to you as my
mayster Mayre, and truelye write and trewe recorde make and trewe
councell gyffe after my discression, when I am cleped thereto or
boden, and all other things truelye do and use that perteyneth to
the office of common clerk of this towne, and the councell of the
towne truelye kepe: so God me help at holy dome.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such were our forms of swearing before the
reformation.&mdash;As to a <i>Lord High Steward</i>, it does not
appear that there was here then any such officer or functionary;
which appears to have sprung up about the time of the
<i>first</i> or <i>second</i> <span class="smcap">Charles</span>:
and it seems an empty insignificant office.&mdash;Quere, if its
origin was not suggested or occasioned by the
<i>bishop&rsquo;s</i> <span class="smcap">High Steward</span> of
former times?</p>

brethren set out from the Hall in solemn procession, when the
following <i>proclamation</i>, according to <i>Mackerell</i>, is
made by the crier&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whereas by a charter granted unto this
corporation by king Henry viii. in the 27th. year of his reign,
that the mayor and burgesses of the burgh of <i>King&rsquo;s
Lynn</i>, and their successors, might from thenceforth for ever,
have, hold, and keep, within the said burgh, <i>one mart</i>,
<i>or fair</i>, to begin upon the day next after the feast of the
purification of the blessed virgin <i>Mary</i> yearly, and to
continue six days then next following, with all the liberties,
jurisdiction, and privileges, there contained in the Letters
patents, granted by the said king unto the said mayor and
burgesses; any act of parliament before that time made to the
contrary notwithstanding; as by the transcript of the said patent
under the great seal of England, more at large
appeareth:&mdash;Now Mr. Mayor, the Aldermen and
Common-council-men of this burgh <i>Do Publish and make
Known</i>, That the said <i>Fair or Mart</i> to be holden this
year, doth <i>Begin</i> this present <i>Day</i>, and shall
continue for the space of <i>Six Days</i> from hence next
following, with the ancient liberties, jurisdictions, and
privileges thereof, and of holding the court of <i>Pie-Powder</i>
for the hearing, trying, and determining, of all accidents and
suits incident thereunto.&mdash;Also the mayor commandeth all
common victuallers, that they utter and put to sale no other
victuals but such as shall be sweet and wholesome for man&rsquo;s
body, and that they do afford the same at reasonable prices; and
keep all assizes according to law.&mdash;And that all weights and
measures which shall be used, be lawful and sealed according to
the laws and statutes in that behalf made.&mdash;And also that
all persons do forbear to put to sale, or shew forth wares on the
Lord&rsquo;s day.&mdash;And further, that all such persons as may
be justly suspected of evil behaviour, do avoid this burgh and
the liberties thereof; and that all others do keep within their
several lodgings from <i>nine</i> of the clock every evening
until six of the clock next morning.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God Save the King</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Afterwards in the <i>Common Stath-yard</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All persons that have any Lastage, Wares,
or Linen Cloth, to sell by wholesale, shall lay the same in the
Common-stath-yard, or in Warehouses, Booths, or Chambers there,
as heretofore hath been used, or as they or any of them shall be
thereunto appointed.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God Save the
King</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly in the <i>Custom House Porch</i> [or rather at the
<i>Cross</i>]&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All manner of persons that have any Action,
Suit, or Plaint, to enter or prosecute for any matter, cause, or
thing, arising within the jurisdiction of the court of
<i>Pie-Powder</i>, here to be holden for and during the time of
this <i>open Mart</i>, <i>or Fair</i>, let them repair to this
place, and the same shall be retorted.&nbsp; <span

</blockquote>
<p><a name="footnote1160"></a><a href="#citation1160"
class="footnote">[1160]</a>&nbsp; &#9758; But here again, before
he proceeds further, or begins the next section, the author begs
leave to acknowledge that be was mistaken at page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page1140">1140</a></span> in
supposing the Lynn Grammar School to have been established in
1580, or about the middle of the reign of Elizabeth.&nbsp; He has
since discovered that this seminary existed in 1570, in which
year, on Monday next after the feast of St. Michael, or
Michaelmas-day, at the commencement of the mayoralty of <i>Edward
Waters</i>, <i>Ralph Johnson</i> was chosen master, in the room
of Mr. <i>Bacster</i>.&nbsp; How long the latter held the
mastership does not appear.&nbsp; If we suppose ten or a dozen
years, and that this <i>Bacster</i>, or <i>Baxter</i>, was the
first master, it would fix the origin of this school about the
commencement of that queen&rsquo;s reign, which seems not an
unnatural supposition.&nbsp; The reader therefore is requested to
correct what may appear contrary to this statement in the page
above referred to; and also in the last line of that page instead
of 1570 to read 1590.&mdash;The author also apprehends that he
was not quite correct at page 1133 in supposing the South Lynn
Almshouse not originally endowed with any land of money.</p>

yet greatly the advantage over that of our meeting houses in
regard to the <i>reading</i> of the scriptures; for large
portions of them are there read every time: and even in the
cathedral service we may find a nearer resemblance of the
primitive practice than in most dissenting chapels, in the
<i>frequency</i> of the administration of the <i>Lord&rsquo;s
supper</i>, which is there administered weekly, as it was in the
first age, and a good while after.&nbsp; There is something very
queer and whimsical in the <i>lunatic</i> administration of that
ordinance in most dissenting congregations as well as parish
churches.</p>

class="footnote">[1169]</a>&nbsp; The knowledge and mental
culture of these assuming beings have been said to be chiefly
derived from <i>Cocker</i> and the <i>venal newspapers</i>; but
the present writer looks upon that as an incorrect and hyperbolic
representation; though he suspects that but few of them possess
very expanded minds.&nbsp; In time, it is to be hoped, they will
become more wise, liberal, public-spirited, and patriotic.</p>

upon an average, each of 40 pounds weight, have been, we are
told, sent from hence by the coaches to London, which in the
whole year amounts to 65 tons 12 hundred and eight pounds.&nbsp;
It is supposed that no other port or place beside has ever
supplied the metropolis with so large a quantity of the said
article, and that Boston, though it is known to deal largely in
the same line, yet falls much short of the quantity here
specified.</p>
<p><a name="footnote1173"></a><a href="#citation1173"
class="footnote">[1173]</a>&nbsp; We are told that by the report
of the commissioners for auditing the public accounts in 1784,
the annual duties of Lynn exceeded those of all the other English
ports, except <i>London</i>, <i>Bristol</i>, <i>Liverpool</i>,
and <i>Hull</i>.&mdash;They might then amount to about
40,000<i>l.</i>&nbsp; But they have since more than doubted that
sum.&mdash;See Britton&rsquo;s account if Lynn, p. 299, and the
table here at page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page1162">1162</a></span>.</p>
<p><a name="footnote1174"></a><a href="#citation1174"
class="footnote">[1174]</a>&nbsp; It may be however not
altogether improper just to observe here that the <i>Gaol</i> or
prison, and <i>Bridewell</i> or House of Correction, stand
contiguous to the town-hall.&nbsp; This building makes a
respectable appearance on the outside, and probably no less so
within; but that it is really so, the present writer cannot
positively say, having never had the curiosity to visit the
inside of it.&mdash;Here he begs leave to observe in addition to
what he has before said of our <i>Grammar-school</i>, that that
seminary now appears to have existed before the reformation, as
may be concluded from the following note extracted from the
Hall-books, and transmitted to the author by the present worthy
town-clerk.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Friday next after the Feast of holy Gregory
the pope, anno 25 Hen. 8. [i.e. 1534.] Lynn Bishop: the Mayor,
Aldermen, and Com. Council have elected in to their Charnel
priest William Leyton, Chaplain; he to have it from Lady Day next
coming, during his life natural, except cause reasonable, and he
to perform the testament of old <i>Mr. Thorsby</i>, and
<i>maintain a grammar school</i>; and further to keep the house,
and tenements, in sufficient repairations in all things as he
can, as it has been used.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="footnote1176"></a><a href="#citation1176"
class="footnote">[1176]</a>&nbsp; The first of them runs
thus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Every subscriber to this Library shall pay
<i>one guinea</i> annually in advance, or in proportion to the
time of the year when his subscription commences.&nbsp; And after
the general meeting in 1798, each subscriber shall pay <i>half a
guinea</i> on his admission, and the same annual subscription as
above.&nbsp; The sum to be paid upon admission to be afterwards
increased by <i>five shillings</i> and <i>three pence</i> every
year, until it shall amount to <i>two guineas</i>.&nbsp; But the
property which each subscriber has in the Library may be
transferred to any other person, who shall subscribe and conform
to these rules; in which case such new subscriber shall pay
nothing upon admission.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 17th is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No book or pamphlet, except it be a
duplicate, shall on any account be alienated from the Library,
without the consent of every subscriber.&nbsp; But if ever the
number of subscribers should be reduced to <i>Five</i>, and
continue at or below that number for <i>three</i> years together,
the whole Library shall be transferred to the Mayor and
Burgesses, to be added to that of St. Margaret&rsquo;s
church.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus the want of liberality in the Mayor and Burgesses, who
neglect to contribute towards any augmentation of their own
Library, will eventually be made up, probably, by this
institution, most of whose members, it is presumed, are
unconnected with the corporation.&nbsp; Had the latter shewed
some liberality in furnishing this society with a convenient
place for a library, there would have been certainly a more
colourable pretence for this article, or proviso.</p>
<p><a name="footnote1177"></a><a href="#citation1177"
class="footnote">[1177]</a>&nbsp; Old Lynn is said to contain 345
souls, and Gaywood about 500.</p>
<p><a name="footnote1184"></a><a href="#citation1184"
class="footnote">[1184]</a>&nbsp; Here it may be expected that
some notice should be taken, and some use made of Mr. <i>Zachary
Clark&rsquo;s</i> lately published <i>Account of the Norfolk
Charities</i>, which makes some mention of those of this town and
suburbs.&nbsp; That account indeed, as it relates to this place,
is very incomplete; but we shall here insert such of the articles
as are not included in the preceding statement.&mdash;He mentions
a house given by deed, by <i>William Cleave</i>, in 1616, and
vested in the Minister and Church-wardens of St.
Margaret&rsquo;s; the rent, 4<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> per annum, to
be distributed by them among the poor of that parish:&mdash;also
that in 1689, the mayor and burgesses granted a duty of
4<i>d.</i> per chalder on all coals imported here, by owners of
ships, or part of ships, not paying to the poor&rsquo;s rates,
towards the maintenance of the poor in St. James&rsquo;s
Workhouse, and which is vested in the governor and guardians
thereof.&nbsp; The average amount of the last three years was
214<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>&mdash;Also 6<i>l.</i> payable
annually out of Grey Friars, given by the mayor and burgesses in
1705, towards the support of the aforesaid
workhouse.&mdash;Likewise for the same purpose, the annual sum of
10<i>l.</i> being a gift, during pleasure, of the <i>High
Steward</i> of the town, and commencing in 1724.&mdash;Also that
<i>John Kidd</i> esq. in 1715, bequeathed 36<i>l.</i> vested in
the mayor and burgesses, the interest 36<i>s.</i> to provide
6<i>s.</i> worth of bread, in two-penny loaves, to 36 poor
people, the six Sundays in Lent.&nbsp; The principal vested in
the mayor and burgesses.&mdash;Also 100<i>l.</i> vested as the
last, a legacy by <i>Peter Ward</i> in 1720; 50<i>s.</i> of the
interest to be given in bread to the poor, viz. 25 two-penny
loaves the first Sunday in every Calendar month; and 50<i>s.</i>
for teaching two poor boys writing and arithmetic.&mdash;Also a
legacy of 150<i>l.</i> vested in the mayor and burgesses, left by
<i>Sarah Dexter</i>, in 1753, the interest to be paid to the poor
men in Framingham Hospital, (<i>Broad Street Almshouse</i>) and
to the poor women in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, (<i>the
Bedehouse</i>.)&mdash;Also a legacy of 36<i>l.</i> vested as
before, and left by <i>James Stapleton</i>, in 1778, the interest
to be distributed to the poor by the Chapel wardens.&mdash;Also
of the South Lynn Almshouses he says, that the founder left
20<i>l.</i> to be secured on a freehold, and the income therefrom
to be applied, one half for the repairing of the said almshouses,
and the other half to provide coals for the inhabitants of
them.&nbsp; This legacy was put out to interest till 1641, by
which time it had accumulated to 55<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i>&nbsp;
This latter sum purchased 5 acres of land, in Wiggenhall St.
Germans, the rent whereof, nearly 4<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> per
annum, is applied as above directed.&mdash;As to <i>West
Lynn</i>, (or<i> Old Lynn</i>,) he mentions there 4 acres of land
at Islington, vested in the minister and parish officers, for the
benefit of the poor; left for that purpose by <i>John Swaine</i>,
in 1678.&nbsp; The rent is supposed to be regularly distributed
according to the will.&mdash;He also mentions a legacy of
5<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> for the use of the poor there, left by the
late <i>Henry Whall</i>, Deacon.&mdash;Also in <i>Gaywood</i>,
(which may be deemed another suburb of Lynn,) he mentions the
following charities&mdash;<i>Tho. Thurston</i> D.D. in 1714, by
his will, left 40<i>s.</i> yearly for ever, toward cloathing
three of the poorest inhabitants; which money is payable by the
mayor of Lynn.&mdash;Also 2 roods of land there, annually let to
the highest bidder, and the rent applied for the benefit of the
poor.&mdash;Also a <i>house</i> in Lynn, the rent of which
(8<i>l.</i>) is received by the officers of Gaywood, and applied
as above: but when, or by whom these donations were made he gives
no account.&mdash;So much for the Lynn Charities; of which this
is the best account we have been able to procure.&nbsp; As to
such as belong to the respective almshouses, that are not here
particularized, the reader is referred for information respecting
them to the account that has been already given of those
houses.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
